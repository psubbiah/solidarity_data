													Hands Off Venezuela","This motion against imperialist aggression on Venezuela was unanimously passed by trade union, Labour Party and solidarity activists who participated in the Hands off Venezuela national conference in London on December 8. For the last twenty years there has been a constant campaign of imperialist aggression (including the US and Spain backed coup in April 2002), diplomatic pressure, sanctions, baseless allegations of backing terrorism, etc. In the recent period we have seen a string of statements and sanctions by the European Union and Switzerland, renewed economic sanctions by the US and even threats of military action on the part of Trump. These actions have a real negative impact on the Venezuelan economy which is already suffering a deep crisis. Threats by Washington should not be dismissed. It has recently come to light that president Trump pushed his advisors to plan a military intervention in Venezuela to remove president Maduro. The US administration was also in direct discussions with coup plotting Venezuelan army officers. Washington has repeatedly encouraged the removal of the Venezuelan government by an Army coup. There are now a series of right wing Latin American governments which have escalated aggressive rhetoric against Venezuela, notably Macri in Argentina, Duque in Colombia, Piñera in Chile to which now we can add far right demagogue Bolsonaro in Brazil. There is a concerted attempt to use the issue of Venezuelan migrants to justify an imperialist intervention. The Hands Off Venezuela conference rejects all of these attempts to interfere in the affairs of Venezuela. None of these governments have the interests of Venezuelan people at heart. Economic sanctions do not help Venezuela, on the contrary, they are designed to inflict pain in the hope that it will lead to the overthrow of the government. The latest scandalous act of imperialist aggression is the refusal of the UK to return the Venezuelan gold reserves kept in the Bank of England. This is nothing less than an act of buccaneering. We demand that the UK immediately returns to Venezuela what is rightfully hers. We also condemn the actions of the financial giant Euroclear which is withholding $1.2 billion of Venezuelan money which was to be used to pay for the purchase of food and medicines. We demand this money be immediately released. We commit ourselves to campaign against imperialist aggression and interference in Venezuela on the part of Washington, Brussels, London or the right wing Latin American governments.

													Hands Off Venezuela","30 trade union, Labour Party and solidarity delegates and activists participated in the Hands Off Venezuela Conference in London on 8 December. The conference was also the English language premier of Marcha (“March”): the new Terra TV documentary on the peasant march to Caracas in July this year. The delegates passed a strongly worded resolution rejecting imperialist aggression against the Venezuelan Revolution. The conference started with a screening of the documentary. It depicted the 21-day trek by land reform activists and peasants, who covered over 400 km by foot to reach the capital . The march was to protest sicariato (the killing of peasant activists by hired guns of the landowners) and the eviction of peasant communities from land plots, given to them under the Chavez-initiated agrarian reform. The documentary follows the peasants as they make their way to Caracas, and are finally received by president Maduro in a meeting broadcast live on national TV. It also explains how, in the aftermath of the march, many of the promises made to them were broken. The film was followed by a lively discussion about the current situation of the Bolivarian Revolution. The documentary has been produced by Terra TV, a new project that aims to provide peasant activists with a platform to broadcast their views and struggles.

The meeting resumed with Jorge Martin, the secretary of the campaign, giving an overview of the Bolivarian Revolution since Chávez was elected 20 years ago in 1998. Jorge explained the gains and conquests in the revolution (in education, healthcare, housing, poverty reduction, etc) as well as the political evolution of president Chávez from someone who talked about a “third way” to an open advocate of socialism. Jorge also explained the constant imperialist aggression the revolution has suffered, from the April 2002 coup, to the oil sabotage of December 2002, the multiple guarimbas (violent street riots), coup plots, assassination attempts, diplomatic pressure and economic sabotage. All of this has been instigated by the Venezuelan oligarchy and imperialism, chiefly in the US but also Spain and the EU. Finally, Jorge explained the current economic crisis facing Venezuela, the reasons for it and its impact on the mass of working people, peasants and the poor. He said that the revolution could only be saved by completing it along the lines that Chavez advocated in his last speeches; with the “pulverisation of the bourgeois state” and a socialist economy. Amongst those present was Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK, Rocío Maneiro, who also addressed the conference. She explained the urgent need to oppose sanctions against Venezuela and explained the impact these are having. She also commended the discussion at the HOV conference “for dealing with the real problems facing the revolution”. Attending the conference were delegates from the NUJ, UCU, PCS, the Coventry Trades Council; in addition to comrades from Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and many other countries. There was a fruitful discussion about the challenges facing the Bolivarian Revolution in which all agreed that our first duty is to fight against sanctions, coup plotting and any form of imperialist aggression. The conference passed a unanimous resolution (see full text here ) along these lines, which included special reference to the scandalous behaviour of the Bank of England, which is currently withholding 14 tonnes of gold belonging to Venezuela, worth 431 million pounds. Banking institution Euroclear was also condemned for refusing to clear $1.2bn which Venezuela had sent in order to pay for the import of medicines and food. The conference also approved the campaigns’ accounts and elected a new committee to coordinate its activities in the next period. The HOV conference also passed a motion welcoming the formation of the European Network in Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution and decided to affiliate to and participate in it. As the conference came to an end, comrades joined the Movement of Ecuadorians in the UK at their social in nearby SOAS.",NA,NA

													Hands off Venezuela","Nearly 100 people packed the #HandsOffVenezuela meeting in London on 30 January, and heard Venezuelan ambassador Rocío Manero, Alan Woods (International Marxist Tendency), Steve Hedley (Assistant General Secretary of the RMT) and Jorge Martín (Hands Off Venezuela) discuss the ongoing imperialist coup in Venezuela, the UK’s role in it, and what can be done to fight it. The meeting also heard a message from John McDonnell MP, rejecting Trump's attempt to manufacture regime change, and declaring solidarity with the people of Venezuela. Over 1,000 people followed the livestream of the meeting from all over the world. The meeting had been organised at very short notice and the venue was not been confirmed until the very last minute, but none of this prevented a large number of socialists, Latin American activists and solidarity campaigners from packing the room in Student Central. First to speak was Rocío Maneiro, Ambassador of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the UK, who explained that the US is breaking international law in order to dictate to the people of Venezuela what they should do. She stated, quite rightly: She thanked those present for their support for the Venezuelan people and stressed the seriousness of the situation. She was followed by Alan Woods from the International Marxist Tendency and founder of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Alan denounced the hypocrisy of the US and its long history of intervention in other countries – Chile, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. – all in the name of “humanitarian concerns” and “restoration of democracy”. As Alan pointed out: He added: Alan encouraged all those present to redouble their efforts to support the Bolivarian Revolution and oppose imperialism. Steve Hedley, Assistant General Secretary of the RMT trade union, explained to the meeting how he had been part of a delegation of election observers in Venezuela in 2017. He described the Venezuelan election system as fool-proof, based on electronic voting and ID checking, as well as the tallying of paper receipts of the vote against the machine results. He noted: Steve stressed the “absolute solidarity to the comrades in Venezuela on behalf of the RMT”. He added “we cannot allow US intervention to change the government in Venezuela. Solidarity!” Jorge Martín, from the Hands off Venezuela campaign, lashed out against the lies and half-truths in the mass media, which are being used to prepare for foreign imperialist intervention: He continued: There was a lively debate, in which attendees at the meeting also discussed the issue of the Venezuelan gold being withheld by the Bank of England (US$1.2bn), which was described as an “act of piracy and buccaneering”; as well as what can we do concretely to fight this attempted coup. The meeting also heard a message from John McDonnell MP who apologised for not being present. The statement reads:",NA,NA

													Marxist Student Federation","On Saturday, February 16, over 100 students representing Marxist Societies at over 30 universities across Britain met in London for the Marxist Student Federation national conference. One of the points of the agenda was the current ongoing Trump coup in Venezuela. The MSF conference heard Hands off Venezuela international secretary Jorge Martín, who explained that what we are witnessing is the latest act in a 20 year campaign by Washington to crush the Bolivarian revolution. Jorge denounced the real reasons behind this imperialist aggression, which have nothing to do with “humanitarian aid” nor with any concern for “democracy”. If anyone had any doubt, you just have to see who they have put in charge: Elliot Abrams, who was involved in the Iran-Contra scandal and oversaw the use of death squads and reactionary paramilitary gangs in Central America in the 1980s in defence of US imperialist interests.” Jorge called on all to redouble the efforts to oppose not only US imperialism but also the role of the UK government in Trump’s coup attempt, highlighting the fact that the Bank of England is withholding US$1.2bn in Venezuelan gold, something which he described as “an act of piracy and buccaneering”. >After a short discussion the MSF conference unanimously voted a motion against US imperialism and in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution: The Marxist Student Federation rejects the current attempt by US imperialism to carry out a coup in Venezuela. What we are witnessing is a blatant attempt to remove the Venezuelan government of president Maduro by a coalition of countries, led by Trump. This is the latest episode in a 20-year campaign against the Bolivarian Revolution, a campaign that has involved military coups, paramilitary infiltrations, sanctions, diplomatic pressure, violent rioting and assassination attempts. At the instruction of the White House and after meetings in Washington, Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself “president in charge” at a street rally in Caracas on 23 January. This declaration has no legitimacy whatsoever, but he was immediately recognised as such by Trump, Bolsonaro, Duque, Macri and Almagro. Others followed, including 19 EU countries. They then called on the Venezuelan Army to declare its loyalty to the new “president”. This was followed by the US imposing sanctions on the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA and seizing its assets in the US, worth US$7bn. An additional US$1.2bn in gold belonging to Venezuela is being withheld by the Bank of England on instructions from the US. The aim is to asphyxiate the Venezuelan economy into submission. These acts of blatant imperialist aggression are being carried out under the cover of “democracy” and “humanitarian aid”. Let us be clear, imperialism lied about its reasons for invading Iraq (“weapons of mass destruction”), lied about the bombing of Libya and has always attempted to find a justification for imperialist aggression. The US government, which is building a wall to keep migrants out, locks in cages those who manage to get in and separates children from their parents, is clearly not at all worried about the plight of Venezuelan migrants. Trump has appointed Elliot Abrams as the person in charge of overseeing all operations to “restore democracy in Venezuela”. That tells you all you need to know about it. Abrams organised US funding for the counter-revolutionary Contras in Nicaragua and backed the death squads in El Salvador and Guatemala in the 1980s. The coup has three main aims. One is to smash the Bolivarian Revolution, an aim which Washington has pursued by different means for 20 years. Secondly, this would allow US imperialism to get control of Venezuela’s oil and mineral wealth. Finally, this would also serve as a lesson to the workers and peasants throughout the continent and particularly as a clear threat to the Cuban Revolution. If this attempted coup succeeds it will have disastrous consequences for working people in Venezuela and beyond. Guaidó has already announced his programme: the privatisation of nationalised companies (electricity, steel, telecommunications, cement, etc) and the expropriated landed estates; the “opening up” of the oil industry to foreign multinationals on very favourable terms; mass layoffs of public sector workers; the destruction of all social programmes; privatisation of health care and education; a “balanced budget”… This is an open programme of reaction on the social and economic fields. In order to implement these measures, such a government would have to crush the resistance of workers and peasants by suppressing democratic freedoms, attacking trade union and community organisations and arresting their leaders. Knowing the character of the reactionary opposition mobs and their track record, we could also expect lynch mobs to attack chavista supporters. All socialists, anti-imperialists and consistent democrats have a duty to oppose this coup with all our might. There is no room for vacillation. It is not possible to adopt a “neither, nor” position in the face of a blatant imperialist aggression. This situation has been aggravated by the vacillations of Maduro and the PSUV bureaucracy and their constant attempts to seek a compromise with imperialism and the Venezuelan ruling class. The continuation of that policy today would have disastrous consequences. The coup attempt must be fought by mobilising the revolutionary workers and peasants, and striking blows against imperialism and its local agents: the oligarchy (bankers, capitalists and landowners). The militias should be strengthened, armed and developed in every working-class neighbourhood, factory and peasant community. Guaidó has openly called for a military coup, has cheered the US seizure of Venezuelan property and is now calling for US military aggression. He is betraying the Venezuelan people. He should be arrested and put on trial, and the coup-plotting National Assembly should be closed down. Multinational companies from the countries involved in the coup should be expropriated. The properties of those oligarchs involved in the coup should be expropriated. The landed estates should be handed over to the peasants. These properties should be put under workers’ and peasants’ control as the basis for a democratic plan of production to address the present crisis and meet the urgent needs of the Venezuelan masses. The Marxist Student Federation commits itself to continue and redouble the efforts of the Hands off Venezuela campaign and take it into the labour and youth movement worldwide with all our forces. We call on all left-wing, trade union and youth organisations to join this campaign. Hands off Venezuela! No coup, no imperialist war! Expropriate the imperialists and the oligarchy!

			Venezuelan opposition attempts to disrupt London meeting",2017-05-28T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","On Monday 22nd May a sizeable group of Venezuelan opposition supporters attempted to disrupt a solidarity meeting in London. Who are they and what did they want? The meeting had been called by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign jointly with the Marxist Student Federation with the aim of hearing an eyewitness report from Jorge Martin, secretary of the HOV campaign who had just returned from Venezuela. Soon after we arrived at the venue, half an hour before the announced starting time for the meeting, a group of Venezuelan opposition supporters arrived and sat down. They brought banners and signs and were clearly attempting to disrupt the meeting. We later found out that they had been organising for a week and had gathered before hand 5pm outside Russell Sq station) in order “to fine tune the details and assign individual and group actions”. They were outraged at a “pro-chavista and communist action” taking place. They had even created a private Facebook group in order to coordinate their “intervention”. The group had been created by Alejandro Parias who announced it on a Venezuelans in the UK Facebook group. Alejandro Parias (who describes himself as a “Physiotherapist, P.T, and beauty therapist working with muscular re-education for celebrities&VIP”) is also mentioned as the contact person for coordinating the intervention at our meeting in several of the call outs which were circulated. He was certainly present at the meeting and was one of the people who led the attempt to disrupt the meeting. Very actively promoting the call to disrupt our meeting was the London branch of GANA Venezuela ( Great National Alliance for the Rescue of Venezuela ). GANA is a new Venezuelan opposition organisation created earlier this year which distinguishes itself from the main MUD opposition coalition by their rejection of all electoral tactics and their insistence that “the regime can only be overthrown” and their insistence that the army should intervene (that is, carry out a coup against the democratically elected government). They also insist in a policy of no dialogue with the government, claim to follow the dictates of Jesus Christ and one of their programmatic points is the “condemnation of communism and any other form of totalitarianism” as well as “the defence of private property and private business”. That is to say that within the reactionary nature of the Venezuelan opposition, they belong to its clerical, coup-plotting, rabidly anti-communist far right. One of the founders and main figureheads of GANA is the journalist Nitu Pérez Osuna, formerly an anchor at Globovisión, who distinguished herself for insisting that Nicolás Maduro is in reality Colombian, not Venezuelan, and therefore is not even qualified to be president (a similar argument to the one used by the far right against Obama in the US). Not all Venezuelan oppositionists at the meeting belonged to this far right fringe, but clearly it was this group of people who can only be described (by their ideas and their actions) as fascists, who led and coordinated the attempt to shut down the meeting. Also present were representatives of Voluntad Popular as well as the coordinator of the MUD in London. Although some more normal opposition supporters might have been genuine ashamed of behaviour of these far right thugs, they never challenged them to drop their behaviour. On several occasions they tried to interrupt the speaker, but the real nature of their ideas and intentions was revealed as soon as the question and answer part of the meeting started. They stood up in unison, put on scarves covering their faces and started to shout at the rest of the meeting, while very aggressively filming everyone present with their cell phones and GoPro cameras. During the meeting they couldn’t keep quiet while other people were expressing their views and constantly interrupted other speakers, despite the fact that they were allowed to have their say. Despite one of them protesting they were not racists, they shouted racist abuse at a Bolivian comrade who spoke as well as taking exception to a Colombian comrade who also spoke in defence of the revolution. Whenever they managed to make a point their class outlook came out very clearly. One of them complained that his father’s coffee factory had gone bankrupt because of the government price controls which didn’t allow them to make a profit and “create lots of jobs”. Another criticised the Venezuelan government’s social housing program which has built and delivered 1.6 million homes, because the people who had gotten them “didn’t own the homes”. One of the points they stressed was “we are Venezuelans, you are not” and “there are no chavista Venezuelans in the room”. First of all, it is neither easy nor cheap to emigrate to the UK from Venezuela, something which is only possible for people with a certain amount of money at their disposal. That tells you something about the class divide between the opposition and the revolutionaries in Venezuela. However, there were a number of Venezuelan chavistas in the room, but they chose not to speak in the face of the threatening attitude of the opposition supporters. Given the current climate of violence and threats against supporters of the Bolivarian revolution, they were sensible not to identify themselves. At the end of the meeting, instead of listening to the speaker attempt to reply the points made during the discussion, again they disrupted the proceedings, shouting, standing up, shoving their cameras into people's’ faces and left the room proffering various threats as well as allegations that we had been “paid to tell lies”. One of the oppositionists most vocal in his threats when leaving the room was C. Javier Rodriguez Rondon , who lives in Brighton and Hove, and had already threatened violence before the meeting (“who knows anything about these rats, so I can beat them up myself”). What became clear to anyone who attended the meeting was that these people did not come to the meeting just to tell “their truth” or to engage in a debate. Their intention was clearly to disrupt the meeting and prevent anyone else from expressing their points of view. What they clearly revealed was the undemocratic and reactionary nature of the Venezuelan opposition. The attempt to disrupt the meeting in London is not an isolated event. Venezuelan opposition supporters have organised a lynch mob against chavistas abroad , publishing the names and addresses of supporters of the revolution, government and embassy officials as well as those of their children and relatives and encouraged opposition supporters “to get them”. In Madrid, a threatening mob of opposition supporters besieged a cultural building of the Venezuelan embassy where a solidarity meeting was taking place and did not allow anyone out (with threats of violence) for 5 hours. Once people were finally allowed out, some of them were followed, harassed and punched, as was the case with a Peruvian national. Members of Hands Off Venezuela have received threats of violence for the part they played in a solidarity picket at the Venezuelan consulate in Frankfurt . Now threats of violence by someone with open Nazi sympathies have also been issued against HOV activists in Belgium who are participating in the organisation of a solidarity event. We will not be cowed. We will not change our commitment to defend the Bolivarian revolution just because a few far right thugs attempt to shut us down. We will mobilise the full power of the organised labour movement, the solidarity movement and the democratic and progressive public opinion to defend our right to express our ideas and prevent our meetings from being disrupted by fascist thugs.

													Hands Off Venezuela","This is a solidarity resolution passed by the federations of Linksjugend ['solid] (Left Youth) in the German states of Lower Saxony and Hesse. Hands off Venezuela! – Defend the achievements of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela! – Accomplish the legacy of Hugo Chávez! – Venezuela mustn't become a second Chile! Linksjugend ['solid] in Lower Saxony appreciates the great progress that the process of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela has brought to broad layers of the population in the fields of social security, education, health and democratic participation since 1999. The Venezuelan oligarchy has never accepted the process of the Bolivarian revolution and will never reconcile with a government which takes measures on behalf of the majority of the population. It has already planned to overthrow the deceased President Hugo Chávez by the sabotage of the oil production and massive lockouts in 2002-03. Today it contributes significantly to the economic problems in the country using measures like improper hoarding, speculation and sabotage and it will continue doing this as long as it keeps its economic power and is not deprived of power and expropriated. We reject all attempts of the Venezuelan oligarchy, the US administration and other western governments and the bourgeois media to prepare the ground for overthrowing the government of the United Socialist Party (PSUV) under President Nicolas Maduro, which has more than seven million members, and the destruction of the revolutionary achievements while justifying these actions medially. We reject US President Barack Obama's recent executive order, in which he declared a state of emergency with regard to the bilateral relations between the USA and Venezuela and in which he described the situation in Venezuela as an "" unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States"". It is not Venezuela that threatens the security of other countries, but it is the US governments that have a long and bloody history of direct and indirect interventions leading to the fall of unpopular governments. The campaign of reactionary and fascist forces to destabilize the country are reminding us of the situation in Venezuela before the attempted coup in April 2002 and before the military coup in Chile in 1973. The courageous commitment of the workers and the poor layers saved the Chávez government and its achievements in 2002 and 2003. Today we express our solidarity in the first place with the forces who are striving for direct democracy, the control of production and daily life and the self-defence against fascist attacks in the occupied factories and residential areas. This is also the best guarantee against bureaucratic tendencies and paternalism. The reactionary advance can only be stopped and hit back by determination and a mobilization of all forces from the bottom-up as well as the expropriation and the deprivation of power of the oligarchy. Much in line with Hugo Chavez it is now an urgent priority to deepen and accomplish the process of the Bolivarian revolution. We support activities for exchanging experiences with the Bolivarian movement, the PSUV and its youth organization Juventud PSUV and other actions of international solidarity and education. In connection with this we are going to support the worldwide campaign ""Hands off Venezuela"". The late President Hugo Chávez was well aware that without the conscious participation of the workers and the poor layers in industry, society and state there will be no 21 st Century Socialism. Sie hat schon 2002-03 durch eine gezielte Sabotage der Erdölproduktion und Massenaussperrung den Sturz des damaligen, inzwischen verstorbenen Staatspräsidenten Hugo Chávez beabsichtigt. Sie trägt auch heute durch gezielte Hortung, Spekulation und Sabotagemaßnahmen maßgeblich zu den wirtschaftlichen Problemen im Lande bei und wird dies weiter tun, solange sie die wirtschaftliche Macht behält und nicht entmachtet und enteignet wird. Wir weisen alle Versuche der venezolanischen Oligarchie, der US-Regierung und anderer westlicher Regierungen und bürgerlicher Medien zurück, den Boden für einen Sturz der Regierung der über 7 Millionen Mitglieder starken Vereinigten Sozialistischen Partei (PSUV) unter Präsident Nicolas Maduro und Zerstörung der revolutionären Errungenschaften vorzubereiten und dies medial zu rechtfertigen. Wir weisen das jüngste Dekret von US-Präsident Barack Obama zurück, in dem ein „Ausnahmezustand in den bilateralen Beziehungen“ zwischen den USA und Venezuela erklärt wird und die Lage in Venezuela als eine „ungewöhnliche und außerordentliche Gefahr für die nationale Sicherheit und die Außenpolitik der Vereinigten Staaten“ dargestellt wird. Nicht Venezuela bedroht die Sicherheit anderer Staaten, sondern die US-Regierungen haben eine lange und blutige Geschichte direkter und indirekter Interventionen zum Sturz missliebiger Regierungen. Die Offensive reaktionärer und faschistischer Kräfte zur Destabilisierung der Lage im Land erinnert an die Situation in Venezuela vor dem Versuch eines Staatsstreichs im April 2002 und vor dem Militärputsch in Chile 1973. 2002 und 2003 rettete das mutige Engagement der abhängig Beschäftigten und ärmeren Bevölkerungsschichten die Regierung Chávez und die von ihr bereits erzielten Errungenschaften. Unsere Solidarität gilt auch heute in erster Linie allen Kräften, die in besetzten Betrieben und in Wohngebieten direkte Demokratie, die Kontrolle der Produktion und des Alltagslebens und eine Selbstverteidigung gegen faschistische Übergriffe anstreben. Dies ist auch der beste Garant gegen bürokratische Tendenzen und Bevormundung. Nur Entschlossenheit und Mobilisierung aller Kräfte von unten und eine Enteignung und Entmachtung der Oligarchie können den reaktionären Vormarsch stoppen und zurückschlagen. Im Sinne von Hugo Chávez gilt es, den Prozess der Bolivarischen Revolution zu vertiefen und zu vollenden. Dabei unterstützt die Linksjugend [’solid] Hessen Aktivitäten zum politischen Erfahrungsaustausch mit der bolivarischen Bewegung und der PSUV und ihrem Jugendverband Juventud PSUV und andere Maßnahmen der internationalen Solidarität und politischen Aufklärung. Im Zusammenhang damit wird auch die weltweite Kampagne „Hands Off Venezuela“ vom Landesverband Hessen unterstützt. Der 2013 verstorbene Staatspräsident Hugo Chávez war sich der Tatsache bewusst, dass es ohne die bewusste Teilnahme der arbeitenden Bevölkerung und ärmeren Bevölkerungsschichten an der Verwaltung von Industrie, Gesellschaft und Staat keinen Sozialismus im 21. Jahrhundert geben kann.",NA,NA

			Successful screening of new Hugo Chavez documentary in London",2015-04-16T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","Over 50 people attended the premiere of the Telesur documentary “Hugo Chavez: a portrait from Europe” and discussion on the recent sanctions levied by American imperialism against the Bolivarian revolution on Wednesday April 15th. Speaking were the director of the film, Pablo Roldan, and Alan Woods, editor of In Defence of Marxism ( www.marxist.com ). The event was co-organised by Hands off Venezuela and the Marxist Student Federation. Pablo Roldan first spoke on the inspiration behind the film. He explained that in 2006, Chavez came to Vienna for a EU-Latin America/Caribbean summit. Hands off Venezuela organized a solidarity meeting for Chavez to speak at, but as the President of Austria organized a dinner that same night, they did not know if Chavez would show up. The organizers of Hands off Venezuela really began to panic as thousands of people poured into the venue wanting to hear from the leader of the Bolivarian revolution. Finally, Chavez arrived. He was greeted by 6000 ecstatic European supporters of the revolution in Venezuela. This event, along with a similar event in London, in which Chavez spoke for 5 hours, made Roldan wonder why Chavez was such an inspiration to Europeans. After Roldan spoke, the lights dimmed and the film began. The film explains quite clearly why Chavez has inspired so many working class people around the world. Chavez was the product of a genuine revolutionary process in Venezuela. For decades, Venezuela had been governed by a repressive and parasitic oligarchy that had never attempted to improve the lot of the Venezuelan working class and poor. The election of Chavez meant a break from this. Chavez openly talked of revolution; of doing away with capitalism and building socialism. He built hundreds of thousands of homes for the poor, created a universal healthcare system and instituted free education amongst other social programmes. This served as a huge inspiration to European workers, who only see their leaders talk about the need to be responsible managers of capitalism. Alan Woods spoke on the Bolivarian revolution and the recent sanctions imposed by the US after the film. He explained that the “threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States” that Venezuela poses, as Barack Obama said, is not a military threat or anything of that sort, but the threat of a good example and a threat to the profit margins of American multinationals. Woods explained that we need to defend the gains of the revolution from American imperialism. However, he said that Chavez had only made half a revolution, and that the revolution must be completed by expropriating the capitalists, who are actively sabotaging the economy and conspiring against the government. Woods stressed that if the capitalists are not expropriated, they will eventually crush the revolution. Turning back to Europe, Woods concluded by stating that if Chavez were at the discussion, he would say that the best way you can show solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution is by fighting for revolution in your own country. The talk was followed by an excellent discussion on the situation in Venezuela. A young person from Venezuela, speaking from the floor, argued that the revolution had brought chaos and violence to Venezuela. Others in the audience responded by explaining that the chaos and violence was the responsibility of the capitalists, who are actively sabotaging the economy and instigating violence against the government and revolutionaries. In all, the event was a great success, concluding with chants of “viva la revolucion!” Hands off Venezuela will continue to hold solidarity events until the revolution is victorious. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","A meeting in Brussels under the title ""what is really happening in Venezuela"" had a turn out of 85 people despite threats from Venezuelan opposition supporters to disrupt it. A record number of 85 people participated in the last ‘Jeudi du Marxisme’ organised in Brussels on the situation in Venezuela. The ‘Jeudi du Marxisme’ is the monthly open activity of the Brussels branch of the International Marxist Tendency. This time it was organised jointly with the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Faced with a growing number of questions of activists in the movement about the long tug of war between the violent right and extreme right opposition and the government we decided to invite three speakers at our activity. Ronnie Ramirez a Chilean filmmaker living in Belgium who used to work in Venezuela, Erik Demeester from the Hands Of Venezuela campaign and Luis Vargas of the Venezuelan Christian Workers Youth. Despite numerous threats of violence at similar activities in Belgium and in the rest of Europe by frenzied oppositionists we decided to publicise this activity as widely as possible. Actually the best defence in this case is full publicity. Hundreds of posters were placarded in the streets and FB messages went viral announcing the activity. Learning from the attempted sabotage of previous meetings in Madrid, London and Germany we also warned everyone well in advance (on our posters and FB messages) that we would not tolerate any sabotage of our meeting. A special group of 20 people was organised to do the stewarding outside and inside the hall. The local Antifa group contacted us to help in case of trouble. The local police was also warned of a possible counter demo. We also added that everyone would be allowed to speak, including oppositionists, on condition they did not tried to sabotage the meeting. This bold attitude delivered results. The participants felt things were under control and they saw we took the security seriously. Despite calls for organising a picket against the event and threats of sabotage on the part of Venezulean oppositionists, nothing happened. We also had a surprise visit of the Cuban and Venezuelan ambassadors to Belgium. Erik Demeester, from HOV in Belgium, gave a general perspective of the events in Venezuela. ‘This is a sustained and coordinated attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government and its president. They receive help from the local oligarchy and imperialism. We cannot stay neutral…. At the same time we need to make a critical appraisal of the development of the policy of the government. Concessions to the capitalist class will not quieten them. Within the popular movement there is a growing demand for a radicalisation of the revolution or it will die’. Our unconditionally defence of the revolution against the right wing and imperialist attacks goes hand in hand with critical solidarity. Ronnie Ramirez analysed the role and the tricks the media use to blacken the revolution. He gave some good examples of the media manipulation and answered the lies and distortions published in the Belgian and international media. He also explained how in Venezuela itself the media are still largely under control of the private sector, i.e. the right wing opposition and how local community based media is building a counterweight to the dominance of the private radio and television. Last but not least, spoke Luis Vargas from the Venezuelan Catholic Workers Youth (JOC). For many people present it was the first time they could hear someone from the rank and file of the revolutionary workers and youth movement. First of all he defended the revolution and its conquests. He lambasted calmly all the claims of the opposition about the economic crisis. ‘I will not deny the dire social and economic situation but I reject the explanation of the right wing for this crisis’. Then he went on explaining some of the growing contradictions in the movement between the bureaucracy and other rich people in the government and the state and the stubborn attempts of the popular movement to gain control over the process and press its own agenda of radicalisation. ‘The elections for a new constituent assembly are an opportunity for the popular movement but it could also turn out like the past, where self-appointed bureaucrats take over’. As expected most of questions were directed to him. Some oppositionists present also spoke and asked some questions. What struck the participants was the poverty of argument of those people. All their questions were answered. This was the moment when the ambassador of Venezuela stood up and took the defence of the government and the president against all the attacks they have been suffering. After the meeting many people congratulated us for the activity and continued to discuss until late in the night. This successful activity is giving a new impetus to the solidarity movement in Belgium.",NA,NA

													Claudia Kocabalkan und Christoph Mürdter","„Hands off the Revolution in Venezuela“ was the title of a public meeting in the city of Wiesbaden organised by the local neighbourhood branch of DIE LINKE (Left Party) Wiesbaden-Westend, Hands off Venezuela (HOV) in Germany and Der Funke editorial board on March 28, 2014. The speakers invited were Jimmy Chediak, Venezuelan Consul General in Frankfurt, and Hans-Gerd Öfinger from HOV in Germany. The meeting was called at a short notice to inform the public about the recent right wing offensive in Venezuela. Just a few weeks before a delegation had paid a visit to the Consulate in Frankfurt to express solidarity with the gains of the Bolivarian revolution and concern about the violence and acts of sabotage aimed at destabilising and shipwrecking the revolution. We were and are conscious of the fact that most media in Germany and Europe are distorting the present situation in Venezuela and therefore posed ourselves the target to inform about real facts. The presence of over 60 people including a number of Venezuelan nationals living in the region demonstrated the enormous interest in the developments in Venezuela. The meeting started with the presentation of the documentary film „From Bolívar to Chávez“ which served as a short and concise history lesson and outlined important stages of 200 years of struggle against imperialism and capitalism in Latin America, above all in Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Panama, Chile, Peru, Columbia and Venezuela. This was a good basis to discuss the reactionary role of imperialism and the local oligarchies up to the present day and explain that the Venzuelan oligarchy hand in hand with the ruling class in North America will do everything they can to strangle the revolutionary process in the country and re-conquer full control. Jimmy Chediak described the past 15 years since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution and reminded of the attempted coup in 2002 and the attempted sabotage and lock-out in 2002/03. He pointed to recent attempts by opposition forces to sabotage power supplies and build barricades in the streets to block the transportation of elementary goods. Ordinary people had been shot while trying to remove these barricades. He went on to say that the oil revenues are being used to the benefit of ordinary people. Illiteracy has been abolished, medical care has been established and 750.000 houses have been built for the poor. The discussion was free and fair. A handful of supporters of the Venezuelan right wing opposition had the opportunity to explain their point of view, too. Jimmy and Hans-Gerd as well as some left wing Venezuelans present in the audience patiently answered all the questions raised and brought forward clear arguments against right wing accusations and prejudices. Hans-Gerd Öfinger underlined that revolutionaries should never rely on deals with the oligarchy and not put any faith in their promises and pledges. „They do not want to improve the lot of workers and the poor but just defend their profits, power and privileges. The revolution cannot stop half way. The gains achieved can be lost rapidly unless the oligarchy is expropriated and disempowered“, he pointed out. He urged the audience to step up the solidarity work to defend the gains of the revolution. A solidarity resolution has been passed by the Wiesbaden federation of DIE LINKE and will be tabled at the forthcoming national party congress in May. HOV Germany will continue to organise meetings and other activities. The meeting was also attended by a TV camera team from the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting, BR) in Munich which is a controlled by the rigth wing CSU, chancellor Merkel`s sister party. Yet the report in the BR TV programm kontrovers broadcast just a few days later was full of distortions about the situation in Venezuela and about what really happpened at the Wiesbaden meeting. The main slant of the 5 minutes report was obviously to discredit DIE LINKE altogether as blind fans of an „undemocratic“ and blood thirsty „regime“ in Caracas. The report went so far as to claim that the organisers had „expelled“ three Venezuelan middle class ladies from the meeting since they expressed support for the right wing opposition. Yet nothing is further from the truth than this accusation. In fact the ladies were allowed to express their views which were answered properly. They stood up while the meeting was still going on and rushed to the camera team waiting in a corner in the back of the hall to make statements which were propably pre-fabricated and amply given space in the report. After the official end of the meeting, Hans-Gerd Öfinger was also interview by the BR camera team for about 10 minutes and answered all sorts of political points converning Venezuela and the solidarity work. Yet not one second of his sober political statements was broadcast in the BR programme. We are not going to be disconcerted by suchlike tricks and maneuvres. We will fight back and use the coverage in the BR to explain the truth. We will also remind people in Bavaria and the rest of the country of the fact that former CSU leader Franz Josef Strauss 40 years ago praised the Pinochet regime for having restored order in Chile after the bloody coup in 1973. The meeting was successful altogether. Some young Venezuelans from the PSUV youth in Germany also came in and explicitly thanked Hands off Venezuela in Germany for the energetic solidarity work. On the basis of this meeting already we have received invitations to speak on Venezuela in different corners of the country. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","“WHERE IS VENEZUELA GOING?” was the title of a public meeting organised by the Linksjugend ['solid] (Left Youth) federation in the State of Lower Saxony on Wednesday, 2 December 2015, in the city of Brunswick (Braunschweig). The left youth in this state had declared their support for the Hands off Venezuela (HOV) Campaign earlier this year and invited comrade Jorge Saturno of the Venezuela Socialist Youth (Juventud PSUV) in Germany to speak in Brunswick. Jorge gave a very detailed introduction on the history of the Bolivarian revolution, the enormous gains of the process since the election of Hugo Chavez. He outlined the increase of equality in society and advances in education, health, pensions and other fields where outstanding improvement has been achieved above all for the working class and poorer sections of society, including a sharp drop in absolute poverty. However, it has been clear right from the beginning that the ruling class in Venezuela, the USA and other imperialist countries have never really resigned themselves to this development and have made several serious attempts to overthrow the socialist President and left government. The parliamentary election next Sunday could be a turning point as the right wing opposition hope to gain a majority and then block and sabotage any progressive legislation. Jorge also explained that the serious economic problems of shortages, inflation, black markets and sabotage are largely a consequence of the fact that the oligarchy still holds economic power in the country. There was a broad agreement in the discussion that the revolution which has achieved enormous gains must be pushed forward and completed. The discussion included a wide range of questions and contributions on social, environmental and security issues and the combat against corruption as well as the integration of the whole of Latin America. The comrades will follow the election results with great attention and in a spirit of solidarity towards the revolutionary process. Hands off Venezuela will continue to hold meetings on the situation in the country after next Sunday's election. A further public meeting has been scheduled for next Friday, 11 December, and further activities and information campaigns are on the agenda for 2016. Hans-Gerd Öfinger HOV Germany",NA,NA

			Venezuela ""human rights"" talk in Edinburgh",2014-04-24T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Stefan Smith - HOV Scotland","On April 9, the ‘Venezuela Committee in Scotland’ hosted a discussion on human rights in light of the recent protests in Venezuela. Around 60 people were in attendance with speakers including members of the Edinburgh University Latin American society as well as a brief talk from the Amnesty International society representative who made points about human rights in general, citing breaches in the country. The other speakers essentially told stories of violence carried out by the police and government supporters, violent crime, gave confusing figures about the role of the state in media, inflation and shortages. Whilst of course some legitimate concerns were identified there was no context or analysis as to why there are problems with violent crime, inflation and scarcity and there were no evident intentions of ridding the country of such problems. After the talks there was only enough time for three questions from the floor, two of which were asked by supporters of Socialist Appeal and Hands Off Venezuela. The first explained how in her experience fighting for free education in Chile they built a popular, democratically organized, political movement, which now has achieved representation in certain political structures. She asked if their movement had any political demands or if it was all spontaneous. One speaker retorted by explaining it was because ‘they wanted it all’ and couldn’t focus on particular demands. Interestingly when confronted about the validity of the democratic elections which the PSUV had won, attendees actually agreed that it was democratically elected. This is in sharp contrast to the hysterical accusations made on a regular basis by the world’s mainstream media and shows how when actually confronted, face to face, their arguments have hold no water. Another opposition supporter argued that dialogue wasn’t an appropriate method as people like Leopoldo Lopez were denied a political voice by the government (despite being covered extensively by the global media and being allowed to address his supporters when arrested for inciting violence, as well as his party only winning a solitary seat in the National Assembly). The second supporter of Socialist Appeal and Hands Off Venezuela to speak highlighted the mass rallies held by supporters of the Bolivarian revolution which had been ignored in the talk, the huge support for the government in the majority of Venezuela, the vast gains made by the revolution in improving education, (eradicating illiteracy in 2005 and trebling the university population) fighting poverty, (reducing the rate of poverty from 48% to 27%) and in health care (increasing the number of doctors from 18 per 10,000 inhabitants to 58 per 10,000). In addition, he identified the violence carried out by opposition supporters especially on civilians, which they failed to mention including the killing of 11 PSUV members after the presidential election in April 2013 (unreported by the media), the fact that the opposition supporters had set fire to a government building, which had a children’s crèche (luckily all of whom were evacuated and survived ) and the killing of an unarmed civilian by masked gun wielders for simply trying to remove a road block. A number of people in the room were visibly agreeing with this point and an opposition supporter even said “although I’m 100% opposition there’s a lot of opposition violence which the media never reports”. He also questioned why Amnesty International, a human rights organization are supporting a movement which has killed innocent trade unionists, blocked off roads for ordinary working class people to access their shops and workplaces, and is hell bent on reversing the gains of the Bolivarian revolution. The Amnesty International Speaker came back in to highlight their “neutrality”. She also condemned President Maduro’s “incitement of violence when he called for people to attack the opposition”. In reality what Maduro called for was for the masses of working class and poor people to get together organize and defend themselves against reactionary proto fascist gangs, against attacks, intimidation and extremely obstructive road blocks. This organized and direct struggle is a proud tradition of the revolution and which would not have survived one day without this initiative and will on behalf of the masses of Venezuela. Although we don’t doubt the good intention of many Amnesty International activists and supporters, this does reveal the limits of such charities and their supposed “neutrality” and we would recommend any advocates of human rights to have a serious look at what being “neutral” actually means. After the discussion we spoke to some of the people who had attended, all of them were opposition supporters including one who works in the financial sector and claimed his family see him as a ‘capitalist pig’. His main concern was that because of government bureaucracy, him as a finance worker found it difficult to get economic facts and figures. It was clear that whilst this kind of people were in the majority at this meeting, in Venezuela they were the minority, which they acknowledged; some had family who all supported the Bolivarian revolution. Additionally, no one we spoke to had any real political answers, there was no explanation of what kind of society they wanted but rather they were a broad, supposedly ‘non-political’ movement with speakers attempting to keep the discussion away from any real politics. One claimed that the reason they couldn’t answer our political points was because the Students Union warned them that they were not allowed to talk about politics. This is a bizarre claim since the Marxist Society along with many other political societies regularly hold discussions in the same room. The legitimate concerns they do raise are done so in a cynical manner in order to justify their reactionary campaign against the revolution. Some of the supporters when confronted appeared to desert their own positions with one attendee deciding the “he didn’t actually agree with the opposition movement”. When HOV supporters made points, spontaneous remarks from the opposition were yelled out such as “before Chavez we had the best education system in the world!”, “our fight is for everything!” which was followed by very weak attempts at starting applause with a maximum three people joining in and stopping within seconds. Their politics represent the interests of a tiny minority of capitalists and oligarchs. The campaigners on the ground seem to be mostly made up of a small layer of naïve, frenzied, economically privileged people who are taken in by the reactionary media but whose interests are not actually represented by the opposition movement, hence their vacillation upon mild polite confrontation with facts. However despite being politically weak these movements clearly have backing and funding by powerful imperialists and oligarchs and it must be treated for what it is, a reactionary movement which opposes the democratic will of the people and of the revolution. The opposition and its supporters have no interest in solving such problems of scarcity, most of whom are barely affected by. The scarcity that exists in the country affects the layers of workers and poor people, who as explained elsewhere in HOV have overwhelmingly come out to defend the revolution time and time again. The explanation given by one of the opposition was that the Bolivarian movement are really good at “marketing” and went on to explain how those supporting it were the most ignorant and uneducated layers of society. This is a bare reflection of the complete contempt the opposition has for the masses of Venezuela, the working classes and rural masses who built the country and keep it running, through their determination and will and have gained huge advances in the country. It is essential that whilst we must always acknowledge the problems in Venezuela and offer a sober analysis of their causes and how to fight them, we must defend the huge gains of the Bolivarian revolution tooth and nail. In the end the only way to fight this enemy is to complete the revolution and eradicate all the social conditions which they cynically thrive off. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","The Hands Off Venezuela campaign expresses its outrage at the assassination of Venezuelan member of the national assembly Robert Serra for the PSUV and his partner María Herrera. The way the assassination was carried out was particularly brutal. Robert Serra was found bound and gagged and had been stabbed over 50 times. The Minister of the Interior and Justice, Rodríguez Torres, said that according to early investigation results this had been an “intentional, well planned and meticulously executed homicide” and that the assassination was not a “chance event” but rather a “macabre assignment.” We note that Robert Serra had warned about a campaign of assassination of mid-level Bolivarian leaders. We note that these killings take place after revelations about terrorist plans organised by “student leader” Lorent Saleh which allegedly implicate former Colombian president Uribe. We note that this would not be the first politically motivated killing in Venezuela. Countless leaders and activists of the workers, peasant, indigenous peoples and popular movement have been killed by hired guns of the oligarchy in the years since president Chavez was first elected in 1998. In too many of these cases, the crimes have gone unpunished and those responsible have never been tried, have left the country or escaped while on parole. There was the case of Pedro Doria, land reform activist killed by the hired guns of the landowners in Zulia in 2002. There was the case of the state prosecutor Danilo Anderson, killed in 2004 with a bomb under his car, while he was attempting to prosecute those involved in the April 2002 coup. There was the case of the Aragua trade unionists Richard Gallardo, Luis Hernández y Carlos Requena, killed by the hired guns of the bosses in 2008. There was the case of indigenous Yupka chief Sabino Romero, killed in 2013 by the hired guns of the landowners. These cases are just a small number in a long list which also includes the recent killing of PSUV Caracas Libertador councillor Eliecer Otaiza in April this year. We express our solidarity with the Bolivarian revolutionary movement in general and the PSUV in particular at the time of this tragic loss. We reaffirm our commitment to build solidarity and defend the Bolivarian revolution from its many enemies in Venezuela and abroad. We demand that those responsible be brought to trial and punished.

													Hands Off Venezuela","Over 70 people gathered at the Bolivar Hall in London on March 31 to hear Ewan Robertson from Venezuelanalysis.com speak about the current anti-government protests in Venezuela. Ewan Robertson went into detail about the origin and character of the opposition protests. He had just arrived in London from Mérida, a city in the Andean region of Venezuela which has been one of the focus of the recent protests. He explained how, after having the opposition lost three major elections between October 2012 and December 2013, the government made openings to the ""moderate"" sector of the opposition. However, a more radical wing, lead by Leopoldo López and Maria Corina Machado launched a campaign of street demonstrations called ""La Salida"" (the Exit) to remove the democratically elected government of president Maduro. Robertson explained how the campaign of violent guarimbas or street barricades and road blocks started already in January in Merida and Tachira. Protests then escalated in San Cristobal, Tachira, with an assault on the governor's residence on February 6th. Roberston gave a detailed explanation of the now 38 people who have died as a result of these protests. Contrary to the impression given by the mass media, he reported that a big majority of those deaths were people killed by the opposition barricades themselves or shot dead when trying to remove them. The authorities have taken harsh measures in the small number of cases in which police officers have been involved in causing the death of protesters. You can hear the full audio of his very interesting speech here: Also speaking was Jorge Martin who replied to the most common lies and misconceptions one can get in the mass media. He explained how there are 2.3 million university students in Venezuela (a massive expansion of free higher education enrolment, from about 800,000 in 1998, which is one of the conquests of the Bolivarian revolution) and only a very small minority of those, mainly from private and old style universities have been involved in the protests. He also said that protest have taken place in the middle class and upper class areas, while the poor and working class areas have remained unaffected. Martin also pointed out that in his opinion any attempt to conciliate and make concessions to the opposition would in fact backfire, as it would undermine the basis of support for the revolution. This is the audio of his intervention: There was also a lively question and answer session with many interesting contributions from the audience. Several Colombians present spoke passionately about human rights abuses in their country (which go largely unreported in the mass media) and about how the Venezuelan revolution was an inspiration to them.

													Hands Off Venezuela","Jhon Guerra from the Venezuelan embassy in the UK and Jorge Martín from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign addressed a meeting in London to discuss the forthcoming municipal elections and the on-going economic war against the Bolivarian revolution. The meeting, hosted by the Marxist Student Federation, opened with a screening of “Carbon Copy”, the new ViveTV documentary on the campaign of sabotage, speculation, overpricing, hoarding, etc conducted by the oligarchy against the revolution. The film features Eduardo Samán, president of Indepabis, the Venezuelan state body defending consumer rights and charged with the struggle to make sure working people have access to basic goods at fair prices. The documentary makes an apt comparison of the current conflict in Venezuela with the campaign of destabilisation against the Allende government in Chile in 1971-73 which finally led to the coup and its overthrow. When asked about the danger of “polarisation” in Venezuelan society, Samán correctly replies that there had always been polarisation between the workers and the capitalists, what has changed now is that working people have become aware, conscious and organised. He welcomes this so-called “polarisation” “as the exploited are many and the exploiters are few”, he says. After the film, the debate was opened by Jhon Guerra, second secretary of the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the UK, who explained the importance of the December 8 municipal elections and the context of the economic war of sabotage being waged against the revolution. Jorge Martín from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign opened his contribution by explaining how the campaign of sabotage had intensified in the run up to the elections. On Tuesday, he said, there was a power blackout just as President Maduro was announcing a series of measures to fight against this economic war. Jorge explained how president Maduro has identified clearly Fedecamaras, Consecomercio and Venamcham (the country’s three main bosses organisations) as being responsible for this economic war. The struggle against sabotage has mobilised not only the state institutions but also worker and revolutionary activists and rank and file organisations which have taken part in overseeing and controlling production, distribution, the sale of products at regulated prices, etc. This whole battle has had the effect of galvanising, once again, the revolutionary energy of the Venezuelan people. Jorge Martin added that in his opinion, the economic problems facing the Bolivarian revolution are in part caused by a deliberate attempt to overthrow the revolution on the part of the capitalists, but also as a result of the rebellion of the productive forces againts the attempts of the government to regulate the functioning of the capitalist system. Jorge explained how price controls, foreign exchange controls, etc were introduced, particularly after the defeat of the bosses lock out in 2003, in order to safe guard the interests of working people in having access to basic food products and in order to prevent the flight of capital. However, the capitalists have found ways, legal and illegal, to go around these regulations, and when they have been unable to break or bend them, they have resorted to a strike of capital. In his opinion the only way forward is to expropriate the oligarchy and introduce democratic planning of the economy under workers’ control. He quoted the example of 19th century Venezuelan revolutionary Ezequiel Zamora who famously said that “those who should be expropriated are the oligarchy – they should be left with nothing but their shirts, because with their wealth they wage a war against the people”. Jorge said that there are, in his opinion, three challenges facing the Venezuelan revolution: the expropriation of the oligarchy and the abolition of capitalism, the destruction of the old bourgeois state to be replaced by new revolutionary institutions based on the workers’ councils and the communes, and finally the question of revolutionary leadership. A wide ranging debate then opened with many contributions and questions from the audience. There were questions about the need to organise the solidarity and counter the lies of the media, about the fact that the struggle in Venezuela was not just a national struggle against imperialism but also had a class content, about why the ministry of labour was not always responding promptly to the demands of groups of workers occupying factories and many more. There were some opposition supporters who also spoke to paint a picture of chaos and destruction (burning refineries, collapse in oil production, the spectre of Zimbabwe, corruption, crime). Many of their points were straight lies (such as the allegation that a factory making TV sets had been nationalised so that TVs would be given away to the people for free), others were gross exaggerations and they were answered by Jhon Guerra and Jorge Martín. But the most scandalous point they made was that, at the end of the day, the government was, somehow, to blame for the black market in dollars and the speculation and overpricing which resulted from it! As one of them said “opportunity makes the thief” and that capitalists were just acting in their own self-interest. Jorge Martin replied that in a certain sense this was true, if there were no foreign exchange controls there would be no black market, but that would lead immediately to a massive flight of capital. Why? Because there is a revolution in Venezuela and the capitalists do not think their money is safe there. So, following the logic of these opposition supporters, we should stop the revolution altogether in order to prevent the flight of capital. That would be very good … from the point of view of the self interest of the capitalists! But it would lead to the abolition of all of the social gains of the revolution (free universal health care, eradication of illiteracy, massive expansion of free higher education, the housing program, etc). There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from this: capitalists act in their own self-interest, but it just so happens that their self-interest is in direct contradiction with the general interests of the overwhelming majority of working people of Venezuela, who have repeatedly said very clearly that they back the revolution and want to go towards socialism. It comes down to a question of which side you are on, Jorge said, “and we are firmly on the side of the Bolivarian people and their revolution against the parasitical bourgeoisie and imperialism”.

			British and Italian student organisations support Bolivarian revolution",2014-03-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","We have received the following statements passed by student organisations in Britain and Italy in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution and against the current reactionary mobilisations in Venezuela. As student militants we are carefully following the recent events in Venezuela. We recognize the conquests achieved in the last years by Venezuelan students and workers in the field of education. They are even more relevant if compared with the situation in Italy, a so-called “advanced” country. - In Venezuela university enrolment has increased from 670,000 in 1998 to almost 2.5 million today; in Italy it has fallen by 78,000 in the last 10 years. - While in Italy we are seeing an alarming return of illiteracy, this has been eradicated in Venezuela through Misiòn Robinson, while combined gross enrolment in education has increased from 67% in 2000 to 89% in 2011 (source: Unesco). These results were achieved through the revolutionary struggle of the masses. Today a tiny minority of students – the wealthiest – is demonstrating in a violent way in order to remove the democratically elected president and the government. Thire real aim is not to obtain more democracy, but to open the way for reaction. We are against this reactionary opposition and express our solidarity with the Venezuelan workers and youth. We believe that the only way to defend the conquests of the revolutionary process is to complete it, nationalizing the means of production and putting them under workers control, to defeat the economic sabotage moved by the bourgeoisie and the Us imperialism. Workers and youth participation is needed, both to defeat the armed gangs and to defeat the economic sabotage. Only the working class and youth, organized in democratic committees, can win this battle. We are waging a campaign to inform Italian students about what is really happening in Venezuela and we commit ourselves to work with the Hands off Venezuela campaign to organize solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution. Sempre in Lotta – Student Coordination (Italy) The motion below was passed by the Marxist Student Federation conference on 15th February 2014 attended by representatives from Marxist Societies in 20 different universities across Britain. Marxist Students stand in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution and the people of Venezuela. We express solidarity with those fighting against the economic war and the violence of the counter-revolutionary opposition. The MSF conference recognises the important advances of the Bolivarian revolution in the field of education, achieving such things as: The Bolivarian revolution has the support of the majority of Venezuelans and has won every single election and referendum since 1998 with the exception of one. Despite this the ruling class and imperialism have not ceased in their efforts to remove the government of Hugo Chavez first and now of Nicolás Maduro by a concerted campaign of economic sabotage, rioting in the streets, bosses lock outs, diplomatic pressure and attempted coups. They have been defeated once and again by the revolutionary mobilisation of the Venezuelan working masses. The latest instance of this undemocratic plotting is the current wave of violent protests by opposition students and youth with the stated aim of removing the democratically elected government. On February 12, at the end of one such demonstration, small groups of violent opposition youth attacked official buildings, set burning barricades and clashed with the police. The MSF completely rejects this new wave of counter-revolutionary plotting on the part of the reactionary opposition and expresses its solidarity with the Venezuelan workers and youth and their democratically elected government. We call on the Venezuelan people to remain firm in their defence of their revolutionary gains and to move decisively forward to complete the revolution by expropriating the oligarchic minority which uses its control over the means of production to sabotage the democratic will of the majority. We commit ourselves to work with the Hands Off Venezuela campaign to organise solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution and inform students in Britain about its gains, which are an inspiration for all of us.

													Hands Off Venezuela","Hands Off Venezuela, Bolivia Solidarity Campaign and others would like to express our solidarity with the Bolivian president Evo Morales, with the revolutionary workers and peasants of Bolivia, in the face of the blatant imperialist aggression which held the president against his will in Vienna for over 14 hours. In the evening of July 2nd, Bolivian president Evo Morales was flying back to his country after having attended a summit of gas exporting countries in Moscow. His plane was denied air space passage and landing rights by France, Portugal and Italy which put the personal safety of all those on board at risk. The plane was therefore forced to make an emergency landing at Vienna airport. The Bolivian Foreign Affairs Ministry declared that the reason for this unprecedented violation of international law was the unfounded rumour that Edward Snowden was on board the plane. By 4 am local time, both France and Portugal had changed their position, only after strong protests by the Bolivian authorities and a stern denial that Snowden was on board. Then it was the Spanish government which refused Morales the right to use its airspace. By 6 am the Spanish authorities offered to open their airspace only if they were allowed to search and inspect the plane. Evo Morales rejected the demand which was clearly illegal. It was only after 9.30 am that the Spanish authorities finally gave permission for president Morales plane to fly over Spain. The Austrian police then conducted a passport check on all passengers of the plane. It was not until 11.30 am that the Bolivian Air Force 1 plane finally left Vienna airport. The democratically elected president of Bolivia had been held against his will for over 14 hours. We declare:: Hands Off Venezuela, Bolivia Solidarity Campaign",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","Over 50 activists, trade unionists, youth and Latin American activists, met in London on May 4 to discuss about the legacy of Hugo Chávez and the challenges facing the Bolivarian revolution. The meeting reaffirmed our rejection of the opposition claims of electoral fraud and renewed our commitment to defend the democratically expressed will of the Venezuelan people to elect Nicolás Maduro as president. The meeting was opened by Darrall Cozens who asked the audience to observe a minute’s silence in homage to Hugo Chávez. The first speaker was Yaruma Rodriguez, cultural attaché to the embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the UK, who brought greetings and apologies from Ambassador Samuel Moncada who is currently in Venezuela. He started by describing the benefits to workers in the newly approved Labour Law. Yaruma also explained in detail the functioning of the Venezuelan electoral system in order to refute opposition allegations of fraud. He explained how voters have to identify themselves, their ID cards are checked against a picture database and then their fingerprints also checked. Voting is electronic but then each voter receives a paper receipt in order to confirm the vote which is put in a box. After the closing of the polling stations, 56% of all polling booths are chosen at random for an audit, which involves checking the machine registered vote against the paper receipts. This audit is public and takes place in front of witnesses from both the Bolivarian and the opposition campaigns. Furthermore, the actual voting system underwent a whole series of audits which were witnessed by opposition and socialist technicians. ( Full text of his speech can be found here ) We then screened a number of short clips of Hugo Chavez. This included part of his BBC Hard Talk interview, when he stated that “there can be no democracy under capitalism, only in socialism can there be genuine democracy”; his statement at the Copenhagen climate summit that “socialism is the only way to save the world and you can only do it through revolution”; his rebuttal of “the stupid people of Fox News”, as well as his defence of socialism and thanks to the Hands Off Venezuela campaign during his visit to London. This was followed by Alan Woods, founder of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and a friend of Hugo Chávez, who spoke at length about the legacy of the late Venezuelan president and revolutionary leader. Mixing personal anecdotes with political analysis Alan described the crucial role which Chávez had played in the Bolivarian revolution. “There was a chemical reaction between the revolutionary masses and the president”, he said, “the fed on each other.” Alan described Chávez as a “corageous revolutionary leader” who stood “head and shoulders above most of the leaders of the Left in Europe.” Coming from a military background, “he joined the Army so he would be able to play baseball”, he dared to challenge the power of the oligarchy and of imperialism. Alan Woods explained some of the main achievements of the revolution, in the fields of health care, education, housing, etc. but also underlined that this was not even the main reason for the mass support for Chavez, which had to be found in a different factor: “Chavez gave voice to the poor, the working people, the dispossed, those who had never had a voice before”, said Alan explaining that this was the reason why millions turned out at his funeral. Alan also stressed the role Chavez had played in bringing back the debate about socialism, describing how this was received with enthusiasm by the workers and peasants gathered at the Teresa Carreño Theatre, but with horror by many bureaucrats and careerists in the Bolivarian movement. The Bolivarian revolution can only be completed by expropriating the oligarchy, Alan underlined. Describing an incident in which he had been invited to ride in the presidential car during the summit of non-aligned countries in Margarita Island, Alan explained how Chávez pointed at the waving crowds of Bolivarian supporters and said: “These are the people who must take control of this Revolution.” The fate of the revolution, which has not yet been completed, lies in the revolutionary masses, concluded Alan. This was followed by a lively discussion. Amongst those speaking was Alberto Durango, one of the leading activists of the campaign to organise cleaners in London, the majority of whom are Latin American immigrants, many of them without legal papers. In his reply Alan stressed something which Chávez always repeated: “the best way to defend the Venezuelan revolution is to fight for socialism in Britain!” The afternoon session was centered on the report by Yenny Cortez, from the Gotcha occupied textile factory in Aragua, Venezuela, our guest speaker. She explained in detail the struggle of the women workers of Gotcha, starting from their immediate demands for full rights and benefits against the employer, their attempt to organise a union, and how this led them to occupy the premises and eventually to re-start production under workers’ control. She explained how their struggle was part of a wider movement of occupied factories and the movement for workers’ control. “We have had to struggle not only against the old owners and for nationalization under workers’ control, but also against bureaucrats within the state institutions who are sabotaging workers’ control,” she said. The way forward is to create a “workers’ state, one which is controlled by the workers and peasants, to show the bureaucracy that we are fully prepared to take over the running of society and brush them aside.” This was a moving speech which showed the transformation of ordinary working people in the process of the Venezuelan revolution. (You can watch her whole speech in this VIDEO in Spanish and English:. The next speaker was Jorge Martín who explained in detail the attempted coup carried out by the opposition after the April 14 elections. “The mass media have talked of ‘post-election violence’, but never mentioned that the 9 people killed were all Bolivarian, socialist supporters,” he said. He also went on to discuss why the election result had been so narrow. “In effect, between 600 and 700,000 people who voted for Chávez on October 7, 2012, then voted for the opposition candidate on April 14,” Jorge said, “and this is the result of the fact that the revolution has not been completed and the capitalists are continuing to sabotage the economy”. Jorge said that in his opinion there were three main challenges facing the Bolivarian revolution in the next period. One, that of the economy, which continued to be capitalist but was hampered by many regulations introduced by the government to alleviate the impact of capitalism on working people. “You cannot regulate the free market, if you attempt to do so you end up with sabotage, investment strike, flight of capital, hoarding and speculation,” he argued, “the solution is the expropriation of the means of production under workers’ control.” “In fact,” he explained, “it would be sufficient to expropriate the properties of those who signed the Carmona decree of the April 2002 coup, that would put an end to capitalism in Venezuela.” Second was the question of the state apparatus, which was still largely the old capitalist state. “This needs to be destroyed and replaced by new revolutionary institutions based on the workers’ councils and the communes, as it is stated in the election program Chávez stood on in October”. Finally there was the question of revolutionary organization and leadership, which was constantly suffocated by the bureaucracy within the Bolivarian movement. A lively debate followed, which also dealt with the question of what can we do here in Britain to defend the Bolivarian revolution. There was a strong feeling that our campaign is not just about abstract solidarity with a far away country, but above all an activist movement fighting for revolutionary change in Britain as well. In this respect the policy of HOV of getting involved in the struggle against austerity cuts, the struggle of the cleaners for a living wage and linking up with other Latin American campaigns and groups in Britain was reaffirmed. The resolutions were voted and amended, the financial report was approved and a new steering committee elected in the best democratic traditions of the revolutionary movement ( see here for the full text of those ).",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","These are the resolutions passed at the 2013 Hands Off Venezuela Conference On the April 14 presidential election Defend the Bolivarian revolution – respect the democratic will of the people On April 14, the Bolivarian candidate Nicolás Maduro won the presidential elections with 7,586,251 votes (50.61%) against the opposition candidate Henrique Capriles who received 7,361,512 votes (49.12%), with a turnout of 79.69%. The opposition refused to recognise the results of the election and has launched a campaign of violence. On the night of April 15 several CDI health clinics were attacked across the country, as well as alternative and state media outlet buildings and journalists, offices of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, etc. As a result of this politically motivated violence 9 people were killed, all of them in the Bolivarian camp. The noisy campaign of the opposition was combined with a national and international media campaign, international interference and pressure (from the United States, Spain and OAS), etc. In effect, the aim was to create a situation of chaos, challenge all of the democratic institutions and prepare the way for a coup, just as in April 2002. Faced with this campaign, described by president Maduro as a “developing coup d’Etat” we note the following: Hands Off Venezuela conference therefore resolves to: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Solidarity with the women workers of GOTCHA - for nationalisation under workers control This Hands Off Venezuela conference notes the courageous struggle of the women workers of Gotcha, the textile factory in Aragua. We note that: We therefore resolve to: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ On the struggle against cuts in Britain and the struggle of Latin American workers in London The Hands off Venezuela conference is outraged by the vicious cuts being implemented by the ConDem government. This is the worst attack on the working class in living memory, decimating jobs and services. We note that this is in complete contrast with the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela, where increased investment in health, education, housing, and much more has transformed the lives of the country’s poor. We pledge to fight against these cuts and continue working within the Latin American community and its organisation. We note that whilst in Venezuela the most vulnerable in society have been empowered by the Bolivarian revolution, in Britain these cuts will hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest - women, the disabled, children, the elderly and immigrants. The effect on immigrants is likely to be compounded as they become victims of scape goating. We believe that we must avoid all attempts to divide us and that the British and immigrant working class must unite and fight these cuts. We note that the cuts and privatisations being forced upon us in Britain are part of a “neoliberal” agenda that was first tested on Latin America to disastrous consequences, creating extreme poverty and oppression for millions. We have seen in Latin America the affects of austerity, capitalism, privatisation, exploitation and enforced poverty, but we have also seen how popular uprising can bring down governments, defeat corporations and restore power to the people. Those who refuse to forget are compelled to support the new revolutionary governments in Latin America and to fight the destructive policies of the current British government This is only the beginning. We will continue to mobilise against the cuts, alongside the other organisations of the Latin American community, by building a movement that not only challenges the cuts but defeats them. Hands off Venezuela also agrees to work with the groups of Latin American workers in London to defend and enhance the wages, standards of living and conditions of these workers, starting with the fight for a living wage. We must organize, resist, unite, and fight. We have to throw everything we have at this government of the rich, including a general strike. We will fight hasta la victoria siempre! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hands Off Venezuela Steering Committee Katerina Annis, Amancay Colque, Darrall Cozens, Jorge Martin, Rodrigo Trompiz, Rob Sewell, Julian Sharpe, Matt Stevenson, Ronnie Turus, Rob Walsh – honorary president: John McDonnell",NA,NA

			Venezuela's new labour law and the presidential elections",2013-05-08T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Yaruma Rodriguez - cultural attaché Venezuelan embassy UK","This was the speech by Yaruma Rodriguez, cultural attaché of the Venezuelan embassy in the UK, to the Hands Off Venezuela Conference 2013 Venezuela’s current Labour Law came into force on the 7th of May 2012 and it is one of the most progressive and far-reaching laws of its kind in the world today. The drafting of the law was a deeply democratic process which involved thousands of regional forums and workshops which gave all sectors of Venezuelan society a chance to shape the law through their ideas and contributions. The new law replaced the previous labour law which was passed in 1997 by former right-wing President Rafael Caldera under intense pressure from the IMF and which had a devastating effect on workers’ rights in Venezuela. The new law also builds on the rights established in the 1999 Constitution which was drafted following the election of President Chavez. Before President Chavez’s election in 1998 trade union membership figures stood at 11%. Now, over 28% of the workforce is unionised. Here are some of the main achievements for of the law: President Maduro has also recently announced a series of government programmes that will further improve workers’ lives: The Great Worker’s Housing Mission will provide subsidised social housing for working families. Workers in need of homes are encouraged to organise themselves into cooperatives so that the government can factor this into their planning and build the necessary homes. Mission Inside the Neighbourhood for Workers will provide ensure that workers have access to a doctor and other medical facilities at their place of work. Mission Mercal for the Workers will deliver subsidised food directly to the workplace to ensure the nutrition of workers and their families. These are just some of the fantastic achievements that would have been lost had Capriles won the election. Henrique Capriles is the latest in a long line of leaders from the Venezuelan far right who have given capitalism a free rein at the expense of workers’ rights. During the election campaign, Capriles presented himself as a progressive candidate who would continue with the many government social programmes set up under Chavez. But behind closed doors he was making deals to privatise Venezuela’s key industries and resume relations with the IMF. Luckily, Venezuelan voters were not fooled by Capriles. He is well known for his ultra-conservative background, strong connections in the business world and his support for the 2002 coup. Just because an election candidate says they are progressive, it doesn’t mean that it is true. Venezuelans learned this the hard way after former right-wing presidents Carlos Andres Perez and Raphael Caldera in the 1980s and 1990s both campaigned on progressive platforms only to abandon their election pledges and defraud the Venezuelan people as soon as they took power. Having lost the recent election, the Venezuelan right-wing opposition have unleashed a wave of violence in an attempt to destabilise the country and overturn the election result. Capriles recklessly called on his followers to “discharge their anger on the streets” which led to the deaths of nine Maduro supporters and many more injured. There is absolutely no truth to Capriles’s claim that the election was fraudulent. He simply wants to throw the country into chaos. On the contrary, the Venezuelan electoral system has been described by the former US president and nobel prize winner Jimmy Carter as “the best in the world” and “the most technologically advanced”. The electoral system in Venezuela is so robust and transparent that it is impossible to rig. Firstly, citizens voting in Venezuela are identified by their fingerprint. The electronic voting machines are activated only when the fingerprint corresponds to the voter’s ID number in the database. This prevents fraudulent behaviour such as identity theft. The voter then registers their vote electronically and the machine issues them with a paper receipt so that they can verify that their vote has been registered correctly before placing it in a ballot box. The voter’s finger is then stained with indelible ink to prevent them from voting again. Since there are two records of every vote (machine and paper ballot), it is virtually impossible to rig the machines and stuff the ballot boxes to match. A total of 17 audits of the voting system take place both during and after the vote to ensure that the electronic and paper ballots match. Then when voting has closed, 54% of the votes are randomly selected and audited to ensure the validity result. It is also worth mentioning that the computer system was tested by opposition engineers prior to voting and they concluded that all systems were functioning correctly. It is also important to stress that the voting process takes place with the presence of witnesses from all parties. Once the counting of the votes has taken place at each polling station in full view of the witnesses, the witnesses sign off the record of totalised votes before it is submitted to the National Electoral Council. I have also spoken to many international electoral observers who also witnessed the voting and the counting of the votes and all have attested to the fairness, transparency and efficiency of the vote. Many British election observers also made a point of asking opposition witnesses whether they had any concerns over the voting and not one single problem was reported. After days of violence the government finally conceded to Capriles’s demand for a full recount. But Capriles then rejected the recount and refused to participate. He then demanded a new election. This shows that Capriles claims are baseless and nothing more than a cynical attempt to sabotage a democratically elected government and disregard the will of the Venezuelan people. The vast majority of countries around the world, with the notable exception of the US, have now recognised the validity of the election result. The reality is that Venezuela has a president who is more committed than ever to continuing on a progressive path of improving the lives of ordinary Venezuelans. As a former bus driver and trade union leader, President Maduro fully embraces the trade union movement and encourages further unionisation to protect these gains. As Venezuela enters this new stage in its democracy, we very much appreciate your solidarity as we continue the fight for social justice in the face of threats from the right-wing opposition. I would also like to applaud the work Hands off Venezuela is undertaking, you can count on Venezuela’s full support. Thank you once again for your solidarity and for welcoming me to this meeting.",NA,NA

			80 people turn out to discuss the revolutionary life of Hugo Chavez in Montreal",2013-04-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Société bolivarienne du Québec/Hands off Venezuela","On Wednesday April 3rd, over 80 people crammed into a classroom at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) to hear about the revolutionary legacy of Hugo Chávez and the prospects for the revolution moving forward. The outpouring of grief from millions — not just from Venezuelans but from workers all over the world — has demonstrated what Chávez and his ideas meant to the oppressed sectors around the planet. The 30-40 person capacity room quickly filled up and by the time the event started at around 7:15pm, there were close to 80 people squished into the room, with more arriving in the hallway. The event was chaired by UQAM student Nichola Gendreau Richer who welcomed everyone to the event, which was organized by the Étudiant-e-s socialistes of UQAM, in collaboration with the Société bolivarienne du Québec/Hands off Venezuela, the Venezuelan Embassy in Canada and the International Marxist Tendency. The first speaker was the Chargée d'affaires of the Venezuelan Embassy in Canada, Ana Carolina Rodriguez de Febres-Cordero. Ana spoke about the life of Hugo Chávez, the gains of the revolution, the attempted US-sponsored coup d’état in 2002, and role of Chávez as a great mobilizer of the people who time and time again came out onto the streets to defend their president and the revolution. The crowd listened intently to Ana who spoke in Spanish with French translation. The second and final speaker was Fehr Marouf, a long-time organizer with Société bolivarienne du Québec/Hands off Venezuela and the IMT. Fehr spoke about the inspiration that the revolution has given, not just to Latin Americans, but to poor students and workers all over the world. He highlighted the treachery of the oligarchs in Venezuela who have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate any reform which benefits the Venezuelan masses. He explained that in order to protect the gains of the revolution, it is necessary to complete the revolutionary process — which means expropriating these escualidos who constantly use their power in the economy to sabotage and undermine the revolution. He also mentioned that like the vision of Simón Bolívar, it is also necessary to spread this revolution all over Latin America and the entire world, to wipe this exploitative system from the face of the planet and build a new society. This opened up a vibrant question period where the attendees enthusiastically intervened, discussing expropriations, the coming presidential elections, and the future of the revolution. Also present was the Cuban Consul General, Alain Gonzalez, Venezuelan Consul General Francia Malvar, and three Deputies to the Venezuelan Consul — Carmen Padron, Mary Flores, and Jean Carlos du Bailay. Contrary to the story given by the media and the ruling class, the support for the Bolivarian revolution is huge, even amongst workers and youth in North America. This has been evident by the number of events, vigils and solidarity activities organized across the country. Long live the Bolivarian revolution!",NA,NA

													Alexander Regander, Avanti Sweden","On Saturday 13th f April, 50 students came to listen to Andreas Bülow, from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign i Denmark, talking about the Venezuelan revolution and the herritage of Hugo Chavez. The meeting was organized by the socialist student organisation Smålands Nation and was chaired by their representative, Tomas Kristoffersson. Andreas started by giving brief comments about the revolution and clarifying what defines a revolution; the consiouss entrance of the masses in to the historical scene and the political process in society. He then talked about the role of Chavez, emphazizing not to misstake the revolution as something directed by Chavez from above. Andreas outlined the key historical events leading up to the the rise of the mass movement. He talked about the Caracazo massacre and how this became a tipping point thats releases all the tensions and contradiction that had developed over a hole period in Venezuela during the old 2 party regime. He then continiued to talk about the formation of the bolivarian movement, Chaves coming to power, the social reforms under Chavez, the growing class contradictions and the the policies of the opposition undermining the social and economic situation for the poor and the working class. Andreas rounded up by talking about the election campaign and the perspectives for the revolution and he emphazized that the venezuelan revolution needs its outmost support from socialist around the world. After a short break a lively question and answer session followed, with questions and discussion about the current social and economic situation in Venezuela, the situation in the army and its relations to the revolutionary masses. Questions were also posed about Maduro and Caprilles, the presidency elections and the future of the revolution. The meeting ended with enthusiams and afterwards many people stayed a while for more informal discussions. /Alexander Regander, Avanti Sweden",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","All around the world there were rallies, pickets and meetings against the attempted coup in Venezuela and in support of the revolution. Here are some accounts of those. In London , after several soldiarity meetings during the week and assaults on Venezuelan consular staff by Capriles supporters there was a tense stand off between Capriles supporters and supporters of the Bolivarian revolution at the embassy on Saturday 20. Here's a report: Last Saturday in Central London a group of Venezuelan and Latin American activists decided to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with Venezuelan Democracy, the group slowly started to gather around 12pm in front of the Venezuelan Embassy, by 2 o’clock when the opposition had arrived there was already a group of people chanting “We are democracy, Maduro President”. The Capriles supporters were surprised that there were ordinary people who were prepared to defend democracy in Venezuela. Both sides sang the Venezuelan National anthem and chanted ‘the people united will never be defeated’. The demonstration on both sides was mainly peaceful with occasional angry opposition demonstrators shouting racial abuse or accusing people of being paid to attend the vigil (see this Facebook picture gallery for some examples, warning, content is shocking) Surprisingly there were people in the opposition who wanted to know more about the organisers of the pro-democracy vigil. This type of conversations took place on the sides and some ended with a handshake. We were asked by a Venezuelan of the opposition why were we there defending something that was not of our concern. So, we answered that since the Bolivarian Revolution there is in Latin America a union that we had never seen before, organizations such as UNASUR and ALBA had made that union more palpable and real. We said that the democracy in Venezuela is our concern since an attack on a democratically elected president could open the door for coups d’états like we used to have in the continent. Also, something that caught our attention was a placard of the opposition that said: ‘Remember Falklands, Iraq, Libya… We deserve attention from Britain because Venezuela has oil too!! And more.’ This placard shows how desperate ‘Caprilistas’ are, inviting imperialists forces to occupy Venezuela. The day was a great success for the defenders of democracy as around 5pm the opposition dispersed fast, it almost looked like they had vanished. We found ourselves hugging, singing and dancing. It was clear that we had won, and that our message of peace and democracy was hard loud and clear.

													Haende Weg Von Venezuela","On March 8, around 50 people gathered in Vienna to commemorate the late Hugo Chávez Frías, president of Venezuela. The event started with a song by the songwriter Ali Primera, “los que mueren por la vida”. Marco Castillo, second Secretary of the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, opened the meeting by reading out a message. In the course of the evening he described in a personal statement how he himself, a student from the middle class, came to identify with Chavismo over a long period of political changes in the country. He expressed his conviction that the Venezuelan masses today have such a high political consciousness that there could be no returning to the social and political exclusion of the past. Michael Wögerer, Co-Organiser of the event, spoke on behalf of the Österreichisch-Kubanische Gesellschaft (Austrian-Cuban Society). “I feel like I have lost a personal friend” – with these words he started his speech, in which he expressed his high esteem and appreciation for the late president. He quoted a respectful orbituary by the juventud rebelde and read out condolences by the ÖKG, the socialist youth organisations (SJ, VSSTÖ, AKS) and the Kommunistische Initiative. He then handed the word to the spokesperson of the Funke-tendency, Emmanuel Tomaselli. Emanuel Tomaselli, spokesperson of the „Hands Off Venezuela Campaign“ in Austria and organizer of the 2006 event with Hugo Chavez in the Arena in Vienna, paid tribute to Chavez’ lifework as the largest liberation from poverty and degradation in contemporary history. He portrayed some of Chavez’ exceptional personality traits to then describe what he views as the most important element of his political career: Chavez’ role as the unquestioned revolutionary leader of millions of women and men, who left behind their past and fought for a prospect in live. This was also reflected during the past days in Caracas: “This is not only a time of mourning; this is a revolutionary movement; it’s a promise to defend what has been achieved and to develop it further.” He pointed out that the oligarchy was shaking with fear and that their provocations had stopped for now. This, however, could only be seen as temporary. (As we now know it lasted until Sunday, when the candidate of the opposition, Capriles, with unmasked class-hatred took the policy of destabilization and chaos-making to an unprecedented level). Emanuel Tomaselli put forward his prognosis that Nicolas Maduro would win the coming elections by a large margin and that the Venezuelan revolution even today lives through the mobilization of the masses, but that the most important step – the complete expropriation of the oligarchy – has yet to be taken. Numerous contributors from the audience paid their respect to Chavez and emphasized the lasting effect of his politic. This picture shows Ali Kohlbacher. In two contributions the anger over the biased coverage in the media was expressed. Yahima Martinez, Secretary of the Embassy of Cuba honored the deceased president as a “Child of the Cuban Revolution, who today stands in a row with the liberators Simon Bolivar and Che Guevara.” She emphasized Chavez’ magnanimity and solidarity with the peoples as well as his special relationship with Cuba “in times that we cried and in times of celebration.” She reported the strongly attended obsequies in all provincial cities on the island and explained that the revolutions of Venezuela and Cuba today are an intertwined process. She sees CELAC and ALBA as lasting elements of the unity of the Latin Americas. „Let’s celebrate the lifework of a great revolutionary, each of us let’s do our bit so that there will be no turn-back” – with these words all attendants rose to sing The Internationale.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela - Belgium","Despite a harsh blizzard and traffic disruptions 250 people braved the weather to gather in Brussels, at the buildings of the Christian trade union CSC/ACV, to pay homage to the recently deceased President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. Erik Demeester of the Hands Off Venezuela (HOV) campaign and Veronique Coteur of Intal explained the political significance of the gathering: ‘Hugo Chavez was not only a president of Venezuela. He was above all an international revolutionary leader.' 'He inspired all those who struggled against capitalism, for social justice, for the transformation of society, for socialism. We are not only referring to the social reforms implemented in Venezuela. Above all he gave a voice and hope to the poor and the oppressed from Caracas to the Bronx over Gaza and the West bank. The rich, the oligarchs, the multinationals, US and EU imperialism will never forgive him for this…Those who think that the death of Hugo Chavez will mean the end of the revolution make a big mistake. The revolution we inherit from him will be completed. Our role as a solidarity movement is to continue his struggle against capitalism in our own country’. A dozen people (trade unionists, writers, activists in the solidarity movement, members of Parliament, etc.) spoke about the political and personal impressions that Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution had made on them, with the final speaker being Ambassador Antonio Garcia, who had just returned from Chavez’s funeral in Caracas. The speeches were interspersed with musical performances, videos and poetry and the HOV campaign distributed a bilingual leaflet explaining their work defending the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela. The homage was concluded, not with one minute silence, but with one minute of loud and defiant applause in honour of Hugo Chavez. Chavez no esta muerto, la revolucion sigue !

			Minneapolis, MN: Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution",2013-03-25T00:00:00Z,"
															
													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela","On Saturday, March 23, Hands Off Venezuela hosted a panel discussion in memory of Hugo Chavez and in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution. 50 supporters of Hands Off Venezuela gathered at 4200 Cedar Ave. for a lively discussion about Chavez' legacy and the past, present, and future of the Venezuelan Revolution. This followed a spontaneous solidarity rally of 40 people, held in the rain and cold of Minneapolis two weeks ago, the weekend after Chavez's death. Carla Riehle, MN Cuba Committee and HOV Carla Riehle of the MN Cuba Committee and Hands Off Venezuela facilitated the discussion and ensured everyone had a chance to ask questions and add their own thoughts after the panelists had spoken. John Peterson, National Secretary of Hands Off Venezuela in the U.S., opened the discussion with an overview of the last 500 years of Latin American history: from the Spanish conquest to Simon Bolivar's revolutionary war of liberation from Spanish control. He explained how Bolivar's dream of a ""Gran Colombia,"" of a united South America, was betrayed after his death. He also gave an overview of Chavez's life and the main turning points in the revolution over the last 15 years. During these years of coups, sabotage, social programs, referendums, and elections, Chavez almost singlehandedly put the ideas of socialism, nationalizations of industry, workers' control, participatory democracy, and more back on the world stage. Peterson highlighted the role of ordinary Venezuelans at every stage in defending and deepening the revolution, but also explained that the revolution is not yet complete. Now that Chavez has passed away, it is up to the workers, peasants, and urban poor to complete the revolution by taking the banks, landed estates, and key industries under public ownership and running them under democratic workers' control. He also explained that the only way to keep U.S. ""Hands Off Venezuela"" is to bring about the socialist transformation of society here in the U.S. It is the example set by Chavez, and above all, of the masses behind him, that the imperialists and the local oligarchy and bureaucrats fear. A revolution is precisely when ordinary men and women decisively enter the stage of history and seize their destiny in their own hands. This is what is happening in Venezuela, and as history shows, revolutions do not respect borders! Linda Hoover Linda Hoover of the Minnesota Peace Action Coalition outlined many of Chavez and the revolution's accomplishments. From the many social missions funded by state oil revenues, to aggressively standing up to U.S. imperialism, she explained how Chavez and the revolution have become a beacon of hope for millions around the world. Here in the U.S., the struggle against militarism and imperialism continues, and she ended by quoting James Petras in saying: ""Faced with a violent world of imperial counter-revolution, and resolved to stand with the oppressed of the world, Hugo Chavez enters world history as a complete political leader, with the stature of the most humane and multi-faceted leader of our epoch: the Renaissance figure for the 21st century."" Marcial Castro of Hands Off Honduras and the Frente Nacional de Resistencia Hondureña en el Exterior, explained the regional impact of the Bolivarian Revolution, ALBA, and other institutions and programs that have made a real, material difference in the lives of millions of people in Latin America and the Caribbean. He spoke of the many coups that have taken place in Latin America in recent years, including in Honduras, and explained how these are all ultimately aimed at suffocating the Venezuelan revolution and reversing the tide of struggle that has swept the region. He emphasized the need for genuine internationalism, an end to the artificial borders that divide Latin America and the world, and for socialism as the only solution. Marcial Castro Joe Callahan of the Minnesota Cuba Committee explained the close ties between Cuba and Venezuela, a relationship based on solidarity, not exploitation. He explained how tens of thousands of Cuban doctors have helped provide free care in Venezuela and beyond, and how Venezuela has helped Cuba and other countries with subsidized oil. Even in the U.S., Venezuela has provided free heating oil to poor communities, when U.S. oil companies have turned a blind eye and preferred profits over human needs. He gave many examples of the inspiration Chavez and the revolution have meant for Latin Americans and everyone fighting for real change in the U.S. He also got a hearty laugh out of the audience when he commented that so far no one had said the room ""smelled like sulphur,"" a reference to Chavez's famous comments at the United Nations, after G.W. Bush had left the room. Juan Carlos Estrella, deputy at the Consulate of Ecuador in Minneapolis, Minnesota, offered his greetings and solidarity on behalf of the people of Ecuador. He explained the importance of the Bolivarian revolution throughout South America and the support of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa for the revolutionary process. Regional solidarity, especially between Ecuador, Venezuela, and Bolivia are the beginning of a new approach to internationalism and regional integration. He explained that the next stage of the Bolivarian revolution has yet to be completed: socialism of the 21st Century and the end of capitalism. Carmen Gonzalez, long-time chavista and supporter of Hands Off Venezuela, gave a passionate speech about the impact Chavez and the revolution have had on the lives of ordinary Venezuelans. She explained that Chavez was the most slandered, vilified, and hated politician in recent memory. The words ""tyrant,"" ""dictator,"" ""monster,"" and worse have been thrown at Chavez by the oligarchy, imperialism, and their bought-and-paid-for media, even after his death. So how is it that ordinary Venezuelans were so affected by his death that they flooded the streets, tears streaming from their eyes, defiantly crying ""No Volveran!"" (""They [the oligarchy] Shall Not Return!"")? Why is it that, when he was unable to attend the swearing-in ceremony for his new term of office, hundreds of thousands of chavistas flooded the streets and swore themselves in as president, saying, ""we are all Chavez!"" Why is it that they inundated Caracas by the millions of people in the days after his death, sometimes traveling 2 or 3 days, just to see the body of their leader for a few seconds? She explained that the reason for the hatred of his enemies and the love of the poorest layers of Venezuelan society is one and the same. There is deep almost spiritual connection between Chavez and ordinary Venezuelans, based on shared experience and the very real material gains in quality of life achieved by the revolution, all of which represents a serious threat to the interests of the oligarchy and imperialism. As many in Venezuela are now saying: ""Chavez is not dead; he has been transformed into millions!"" A lively question and answer session followed, with questions and discussion about the role of religion in the revolution, the relationship between Venezuela and Brazil, and the need for a socialist revolution in the United States. Everyone was enthused to hear about the social missions in Venezuela, and broke into applause when the following words by Chavez were quoted: ""this is the century in which we will bury imperialism and capitalism!"" Afterwards, many people stayed to discuss informally, enjoying light snacks and beverages, and perusing and purchasing the various political materials available for sale. $210 in donations were raised to help cover the expenses of the event. The event was filmed and will be broadcast on various local public access channels. Twin Cities Hands Off Venezuela is planning an election monitoring gathering / fundraiser on April 14.

													Hands Off Venezuela (Canada)","Over 70 people crammed into the Yellow Griffin Pub in Toronto’s west end to celebrate the life of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. The fact that so many people came out on a few hours’ notice demonstrates the effect that Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution have on the lives of people around the world. The evening, organized very quickly by Hands Off Venezuela and the Toronto Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel”, was quite sombre when everyone first arrived. However, the sprits in the room rapidly improved as one after another, folks spoke up to talk about what Chávez and the revolution meant to them. An important spirit of defiance arose amongst the gathered students, youth, workers, and activists. Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had welcomed the death of Hugo Chavez. In a disgustingly insulting statement (even by bourgeois diplomatic standards), Harper stated, “ Canada looks forward to working with his successor and other leaders in the region to build a hemisphere that is more prosperous, secure, and democratic ... At this key juncture, I hope the people of Venezuela can now build for themselves a better, brighter future based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.” The imperialists are licking their chops at the prospects of intervening in Venezuela, looking for opportunities to once again pillage Venezuela as they had prior to the beginning of the revolution. Everyone at the pub promised to do everything possible to stop Harper and his ilk from interfering in the revolution. The common refrain from the evening celebration was that although Chavez, the man, was no longer with us, his ideas — those of the Bolivarian revolution — were still very much alive. The best tribute to the late president would be the successful completion of the revolution, and spreading it around the world. Over the course of the evening, the previously depressed mood of everyone gathered had turned to one of comradely joy and solidarity. The celebratory gathering was finished with a call to defend the gains of the revolution, and to build revolutions elsewhere, including in Canada. A rousing chant of, “Uh, ah, Chávez no se va,” rocked the small pub. Hands Off Venezuela supporters also organized a similar celebratory gathering in downtown Montreal where over 20 people came out. They were joined by another 50, later in the evening, at a candlelight vigil held outside of the Venezuelan consulate. Similar vigils were also organized in other Canadian cities, including Ottawa and London, Ontario. Despite the tragedy that has occurred, the spirit of revolution and internationalism continue. Every last person that gathered last night left promising that the Bolivarian revolution is not alone; the struggle for socialism will triumph!

HOV met with another Scarborough MP yesterday and other meetings are in the pipeline. Feel free to answer Karygiannis’ claims of a power vacuum in Venezuela. Dear Mr. Karygiannis: Your Liberal colleague, John McCallum, has this famous quote by John Maynard Keynes on his web site: “When the facts change, I change my mind — what do you do, Sir?” Please do me the honour of reading this e-mail which will contain facts that I believe will be new to you . Despite the physical absence of Hugo Chávez, there is a fully functioning government: the Executive, the Legislature and the Judicial powers have all acted according to the provisions of the Constitution in the case of the illness of the president. One man, albeit president, is not the whole government. The Organization of American States has clearly recognized the ruling of the Supreme Court of that country, that there is no untoward, unusual nor unconstitutional absence of the president. The reality is: On 7 October 2012, Hugo Chávez was elected with a very substantial margin of 12% above his rival and a voter turnout of 81%. This was the will of the people, a fundamental fact, much more important than the date of a formal ceremony. On 8 December, Chávez informed that his cancer had returned and asked the National Assembly permission to be operated in Cuba. It unanimously gave Chávez permission to go to Cuba to be operated, permission valid for 90 consecutive days. On 16 December, the government party (PSUV) candidates for state governors won a landslide victory, winning 20 out of 23 states; it was a victory not only of one man, but a government program and a party. Constant press releases inform about the health of Chávez — up to now, delicate but stable. The Constitution (Article 231) indicates that if for any unforeseen reason, if the president-elect cannot be sworn in on January 10, he can do so before the Supreme Court, and it does not specify a necessary date. The Constitution (Article 234) indicates that a President who becomes temporarily unavailable to serve shall be replaced by the Vice-President (in this case Nicolás Maduro) for a period of up to 90 days, which may be extended by the Assembly for another 90 days. If the temporary absence continues further, the Assembly has the power to decide by a majority vote whether the unavailability of the president should be considered permanent. The Constitution (Article 233) determines that the reasons for a permanent unavailability of a president are : NONE OF THESE REASONS APPLY TODAY. The Supreme Court ruled that there is no absolute absence of the President as he has duly obtained permission (unanimously) from the National Assembly and the Vice-President is doing the duties he is mandated to do. If there were a permanent unavailability of a President, the President of the National Assembly shall take charge of the Presidency and new elections must be held within 30 days. The Vice- president is not elected by popular vote, but chosen by the President. Therefore, if there is a permanent absence of Chávez, Nicolás Maduro has to win the elections to be able to be president. There is a democratically elected president and state governors. There is a functioning government party whose campaign program was clearly endorsed by the vote. The Executive, Legislature, and Supreme Court have all acted according to the Constitution on the matter of the president’s illness. There is obvious rule of law. The OAS has recognized this. THERE IS NO POWER VACUUM OR CRISIS. It is possible that Chávez may become permanently absent, but he has transformed Venezuela into a prosperous country where oil income is used to establish public services (such as education health, housing, food security), not for the exclusive use of the elites as before. As a Canadian I am shocked and disturbed that such a group is taking advantage of you and through you, the Canadian parliamentarian system and the Liberal Party. The so-called Venezuelan “diaspora” is acting under the orders of the anti-democratic Venezuelan opposition. I believe that it has only been the lack of knowledge of the political and legal situation of Venezuela that could have made you allay yourself with people who have fully backed coup d'etats and kidnapping . I am more than willing to have a dialogue with you and the Liberal Party about this situation at your convenience. I bring to you these facts under the strength of my first hand knowledge of the country, its political actors, its language, and laws. Mr. Karygiannis: you can stand with the tiny remnants of a corrupt elite, or you can stand with the achievements and hopes of the people of Venezuela. What you do will affect the opinion that thousands of Canadians of Latin American background have of yourself and the Liberal Party. Maria Páez Victor, MA, Ph.D Board Member Human Rights Press Toronto Dear Hon. Jim Karygiannis, Thank you for your response. I fear you have been dragged into a partisan, political action by your ill-informed constituents. In fact, the Supreme Court of Venezuela ruled it legal for Hugo Chavez to not attend the inauguration ceremony for his government. On January 9, Venezuela’s Supreme Court ruled against the opposition’s interpretation of the constitution, and clarified that the January 10 inauguration was not necessary for the Chavez government to continue in power for the constitutional period of 2013-2019. Two days later, tens of thousands of supporters of the democratically elected Venezuelan government rallied in the streets in support of the current government. Again I ask, is this action of yours official Liberal policy? As for a political vacuum, I see one in Ottawa in terms of the reluctance of our Prime Minister in taking consequential action against climate change and his continuing support of the tar sands in Alberta. Perhaps an emergency debate on that topic could serve both Canada and Venezuela to ensure a safe and secure future for all. Flora Doehler and Larry Knox Bear River, NS Dear Mr. Karygiannis. What an extraordinary statement to make about a democracy in crises and the lack of action from the Canadian government. No criticism of the undemocratic proroguing of the Canadian parliament, you prefer to criticize the democratically elected government of Venezuela. In what way is Venezuela not ""respecting the rules""? This can only refer to the unspoken rules that allow the exploitation of the Venezuelan people by Canadian and other international oil companies. What human rights and democracy in Venezuela are you talking about? Do you mean the regime of those who ruled the country for forty years with murder, torture and the slaughter of thousands of innocent people by the secret police who were controlled by the CIA? Which Venezuelan community are you referring to that is looking toward the Canadian government? Is it the community of the poor and impoverished who have experienced a massive rise in living standards under the present government? The Chavez government has reduced poverty by half and reduced extreme poverty by seventy per-cent, millions now have healthcare for the first time. College enrolment has doubled and illiteracy has not only been eliminated this fact has been recognized by UNESCO. The number of seniors receiving old age pensions has doubled. All this while the thousands in Alberta, which is the richest province in Canada, rely on food banks to live. It is difficult to understand how even the average Canadian could fail to understand that the Chavez government of Venezuela has been democratically elected time and time again under the most rigorous scrutiny. I would recommend that you read the words of former US President Jimmy Carter because it was his Carter Centre organization that was responsible for monitoring Venezuelan elections. Carter said "" I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world"". I would also remind you that the present government on an eighty per-cent turn out received fifty five per-cent of the vote. Would you challenge these kind of figures with regard to an election in Canada ? I think not. There is an ongoing campaign by international big business who want nothing more than to exploit the people of Venezuela, this campaign is aided and abetted by many hostile governments and their lackeys in the media. The outpourings on your website and your petition to the Harper government do a great disservice to the people of Venezuela. Keith Norman Wyatt Innisfail NDP Alberta Dear Mr. Karygiannis: As Liberal Critic for Multiculturalism you have sent a petition to the Conservative Government to have an emergency debate on Venezuela's democracy. Given the current state of our own Canadian Government and our diminishing National and International Reputation it would be in Canada’s best interest to focus on bringing Democracy back to Canada. I am sure you are familiar with the long list of ‘Made in Canada Parliamentary’ actions that are destroying our own Democracy. And finally an overhaul of Immigration and refugee laws that rejects our traditions of justice and compassion. The Venezuelan people need no lessons in democracy from us. Canadians need to get their own house in order. Please bring to the floor your courage and commitment to restore Canadian Democracy in our Canadian Parliament within our own country. Sincerely, S. Watkins British Columbia Canada Mr. Karygiannis, I am shocked by the statements you have made regarding the democratically-elected government in Venezuela, and your assertion that Canada should be pushing for ""true democracy"". At best your statement was irresponsible, given the fact that the elections in Venezuela are one of the most scrutinized by international observers - who have concluded that they are indeed free and fair. A quick study of international reports on the election process in Venezuela would have made that fact clear. It is a bare minimum that when political representatives make public statements, that they at the very least be researched and not made on a whim. If this was not an honest mistake of fact, then you are intentionally demonizing and slandering the popular government of Hugo Chavez by distorting the facts. It is interested that you made mention of the suffering of the Venezuelan people. The reality is that over the past decade, significant advances have been made to eliminate extreme poverty, illiteracy and to increase access to health, education and other services. The only people that have been ""suffering"" is the venezuelan elite and the multinationals whose obscene profits have ""suffered"" from policy measures to re-distribute wealth. If it is your opposition to elected governments left-wing and pro-worker polices that leads you to distort and attack the democratic process in Venezuela, then that is shameful. To resort to lies and distortion to attack political ""enemies"", especially in regards to a government that has faced attempts at coup d'etat by right-wing and pro-business forces, is itself an affront to the democratic spirit and a malicious meddling in Venezuelan politics. If the errors in your statement were an honest mistake, I would request that you withdraw your petition and apologize to the Venezuelan people and government immediately. Sincerely, Farshad Azadian Toronto",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela (Canada)","The Hands Off Venezuela campaign has received this letter, written by Denis Lemelin, the president of the 54,000-strong Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). Comrade Lemelin addresses himself to Jim Karygiannis, the Liberal member of Parliament, who has launched a campaign of lies and distortions about the Venezuelan revolution. We urge readers to continue the letter-writing campaign, and to continue to spread the genuine achievements and state of affairs in Venezuela. Mr. Karygiannis: On behalf of 54,000 members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers I am writing to to condemn your recent defamatory and inaccurate remarks about Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelan government. Your statement that Hugo Chavez is running a dictatorship is simply untrue. Venezuela has a vibrant democracy which has actually been tremendously strengthened under the government of Hugo Chavez, with the introduction of the constitution that was written and affirmed through a democratic process. Venezuelans enjoy the right to democratically recall their president, through referendum, which is a right that we in Canada do not have. Jimmy Carter, who has monitored elections in dozens of countries around the world, has stated that Venezuela’s electoral system is the “best in the world”. Since the election of Hugo Chavez illiteracy has been eliminated in Venezuela, poverty has been cut by 50%, and extreme poverty has been cut by 70%. The Bolivarian government has succeeded in providing healthcare to millions of people and massively expanded public education. Indeed, ever social indicator in Venezuela has seen steady improvement, explaining why the majority of Venezuelans have voted for Chavez again and again. Your remarks are unfounded and unhelpful; they should be withdrawn immediately. Sincerely, Denis Lemelin, National President (CUPW) (Click on image for a larger version)",NA,NA

We also condemn the attempts by mainstream media and the Venezuelan opposition to capitalize on the situation in an attempt to achieve what they have repeatedly failed to achieve in 14 years of sabotage, coups, lies and misinformation.The President is vitally important to the Bolivarian revolution and we look forward to welcoming him back soon. The oligarchy and imperialism know this and they hope to see him go so that they can defeat the revolution.

													Hands Off Venezuela - Belgium","‘Companero Hugo Chavez! Presente! Ahora y siempre!’ Overwhelmed by emotion but determined to continue the struggle. This is how you can summarize the mood amongst the two hundred people in front of the Venezuelan embassy in Brussels. A few minutes after hearing the tragic news of the death of Hugo Chavez, the Hands Off Venezuela campaign called for a vigil in front of the embassy the following day. Other solidarity organisations supported the initiative like Arlac, Intal, Iniciativa Cuba Socialista, Comac. Many other people and groups also took up the appeal via the social media. Trade unionists were also present. All were moved not only by the feeling of grief and sadness but also by anger and determination. There was a strong awareness of us having lost a historic revolutionary leader. But the future of the revolution was on everyone’s mind. A Latin-American activist of Arlac said that the only way to save the revolution was to ‘profundizar la revolucion’ meaning breaking with capitalism. The comrade of Hands Off Venezuela stressed that the best homage to Hugo Chavez was to carry through the revolution to its very end and struggle for socialism in our own country also. Others denounced the lies of the media covering the death of the president. Above all Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution is an example of struggle we must emulate here and now. The ambassador Antonio Garcia joined the gathering with the full staff of the embassy. He gave a strong emotional speech and asked all of us present to continue the struggle. The vigil ended with a minute of silence and clenched fists. Another, more political, homage to Hugo Chavez will be held next Tuesday 12 th of March in Brussels from 6.30pm in the meeting hall of the CSC union (Rue Pletincks, 19) at the initiative of Hands Off Venezuela and other groups.

			Letter Writing Campaign: Liberal Party of Canada Attacks Venezuela",2013-01-21T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela - Canada","We are asking all who support Venezuela to oppose the following ignorant and offensive statement by Liberal MP Jim Karygiannis: From his website: http://www.jimkarygiannis.net/petition_and_action_requests/venezuelan_-_canadian_community_democratic_efforts “Liberal Critic for Multiculturalism Jim Karygiannis M.P. Scarborough-Agincourt made the following statement calling on the Conservative government to support the Venezuelan Diaspora in Canada efforts of returning true Democracy in Venezuela. “The people of Venezuela are suffering daily at the hands of the Hugo Chávez government, as the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate. We should maintain solidarity with the Venezuelan people and we must do what we can to help alleviate their suffering.” We are not sure what “true Democracy” Karygiannis is referring to. Perhaps he means the opposition that supported the 2002 coup against a democratically elected government. Perhaps he means the Elites who ran the country for 40 years when human rights were violated with impunity and the international community paid no heed to disappearances, torture, murders, CIA-led secret police, and the slaughter by the state forces of 3,000 people on the Streets of Caracas in 1989. We are not sure what he means by “suffering”. Perhaps he is referring to the fact that Venezuela has: - Eliminated illiteracy, as recognized by UNESCO - Reduced poverty by half and extreme poverty by 70% - Given access to healthcare to millions for the first time - Doubled college enrolment - Quadrupled the number of people receiving old age pensions It is not surprising that the Chavez government was recently re-elected with 55% of the vote in a 81% turnout. And that former US President Jimmy Carter, whose organization the Carter Centre has monitored all the elections in the country, has recently declared, ""I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world."" We suspect that the real suffering that Karygiannis and the Liberal Party of Canada are concerned with is that of North American and European oil multinationals who are no longer able to exploit Latin American resources with impunity due to the democratic uprising of the people of the region. Instead, governments like that of Venezuela are “wasting” their natural wealth to fund healthcare, education, and other policies that aid the people. The Venezuelan people need no lessons on democracy from Karygiannis, who sits in a parliament that was twice shut down by the representative of an unelected hereditary monarch and where barely 6 in 10 bother to cast a ballot. Hands Off Venezuela calls on Jim Karygiannis and the Liberal Party of Canada to withdraw this offensive and ignorant petition and issue an apology to the Venezuelan people, both those inside and outside Canada, and to the Venezuelan government.

													Hands Off Venezuela","On September 21st Côr Cochion Caerdydd (Cardif Reds Choir) sang in the Hayes to raise money in support of Hands off Venezuela. Thorugh this action £43 were collected for teh Campaign. A number of passers by showed interest in the Bolivarian revolution and wanted to know more about it and some even joined in the singing. The choir which was formed in 1983, raise their voices in song each Saturday, campaigning for peace, feedom and justice and collecting money to support people struggliing for basic rights both at home and abroad. We decided that the Bolivarian revolution was a cause worthwhile supporting as it shows how health care, education, housing and other basic rights can be guaranteed at a time when they are under attack in our own country.

			Denmark: Solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution",2012-10-05T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Niklas Zenius Jespersen, Hands Off Venezuela Denmark","On Thursday the 4th of October, Hands Off Venezuela Denmark arranged a number of solidarity events with the Venezuelan revolution. In Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, a small group of leftwing activists assembled in front of the Venezuelan embassy to show their support for the Venezuelan revolution and for the socialist president Hugo Chávez in the presidential election on Sunday, October 7 th . The demonstration was organised by the Danish section of the international campaign of Hands Off Venezuela (HOV). The solidarity picket also wanted to send a message to the Venezuelans: If the opposition should stage a coup or try to create a situation to justify foreign invasion, this will be meet with protests also in Denmark. Organizations in Denmark are following the events closely and are ready to call for large protests against any undemocratic maneuver from the rightwing. In addition, those assembled expressed their hope that the revolution would be carried to its conclusion: Socialism. Although the demonstration was small, it got some decent publicity with an article in the Daily Worker. After the demonstration a meeting was held in the Copenhagen Studenthouse (a house belonging to the Copenhagen student movement). Here Andreas Bülow, author of the first and only book in Danish about the Venezuelan revolution and former journalist for the Venezuelan Marxist paper “Lucha de Clases” (Class Struggle), described the revolutionary situation in Venezuela and the perspective for the election. The meeting had a high attendance of 17, a large number for any organization in Denmark, and was cosponsored by Hands Off Venezuela and Marxistiske Studerende (Marxist Students). In his speech, Andreas Bülow stressed the democratic nature of Venezuela under President Chávez, the massive increase in living standards and the sabotage and undemocratic nature of the opposition. At the same time he criticized the bureaucracy in the revolutionary movement and spoke in favour of a complete socialist and democratic transformation of society. Afterwards, there was an intense discussion with many contributions and questions. All in all it was a good day for Venezuelan solidarity and proves once again, that even in the far no rth, many people follow the events in Venezuela with hope and inspiration. ",NA,NA

			London commemorates 10 years of the defeat of the coup",2012-04-13T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ross Walker","On April 12th, around 70 people gathered at a Hands Off Venezuela meeting at Bolivar Hall in London to commemorate the 10 year anniversary of the defeat of the counter-revolutionary coup against Hugo Chavez, President of Venezuela. The meeting served as the premiere of ‘Cuarto Poder’, a documentary summarising the negative portrayal of the President Chavez in the Spanish media and the reasons for this negative bias. The screening of the documentary was followed by analysis John McDonnell MP and HOV honorary president of the campaign, Alan Woods, founder of HOV and Samuel Moncada the Venezuela Ambassador to the UK. The documentary very effectively shows the influence of the Spanish media. It started by showing passers-by in an urban Spanish street taking part in a random select survey where they are quizzed on their opinion of the validity of available media, their knowledge of state leaders’ names and then their opinions of Hugo Chavez. Opinions on available media tended to be cynical, knowledge of state leaders varied but in all cases, Hugo Chavez was named as the Venezuelan President (even when Sarkozy, Cameron or Berlusconi could not be named) and the attitude of those interviewed ranged from ridicule to hostility. It went on to interview a large group of professionals on the private ownership of media outlets, its use to miss-inform and of blatant lies to the Spanish public. It goes on to show not only the influence of the state propaganda in the media but also that of private companies. Since 2002 the Spanish media outlets have increased by approximately 200 new outlets as the ownership of these has decreased by 35%. These companies vary from insurance/banks to oil giants and weapon manufacturers who then use the media influence the public view in their favour. The analysis of the media’s portrayal of Chavez was first carried out by John McDonnell MP who spoke of the use of the media as propaganda weapon against the Bolivarian revolution. Rupert Murdoch’s involvement in this was emphasised, in his oppression of his employee’s roles as free press journalists. Union membership within Murdoch’s empire has been aggressively discouraged with the formation of staff associations set up to assure that journalists tow the “Murdoch line”. It was also mentioned that around 250 journalists throughout the world a year are murdered mostly due to their commitment to honesty and free press that tragically for them had not served in favour of the more ruthless and corrupt bourgeois. A personal account of the coup was then given by Samuel Moncada, the current Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK who at the time had an important cabinet position in the Venezuelan government. Within this analysis, he talked of the foreign support for the overthrow of the democratically elected Chavez and the replacement with someone more aligned with the ideological views of European and American imperialists. Foreign financial support has been high for the private sector media in Venezuela. Last year alone, $50 million was invested in this and 80% of Venezuelan media is still privately owned, with the overwhelming majority of it firmly opposed to Chavez. It was made very clear that the global bourgeoisie would happily overthrow a democratically elected government that went against their economic interests to be replaced by a dictator that they could easy control. Alan Woods then gave a vivid summary of the history leading up to the coup and the coup itself. Within this he described the vital role of the masses of working class Venezuelans in defeating the coup. “These events are unprecedented in the history of Latin America, he said.”They show that there is a power in society that is greater than any state, army or police force: the power of the working class once it is mobilised to change society”. Answering the hypocritical propaganda of the western media, he pointed out that if any British television station had repeatedly called for the government to be overthrown by a coup and the prime minister assassinated, “they would be closed down and sent to jail before you could say ‘Rupert Murdoch’”. Yet when the Bolivarian government finally took action against RCTV this was described as an “attack on press freedom.” Alan praised the achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution but stressed that the only way to defend its gains against the counterrevolution was by liquidating the economic power of the oligarchy, expropriating the land, banks and big companies. While emphasising the need to step up the solidarity campaign in the run-up to the October elections, he ended with the following message: the best way to defend the Venezuelan Revolution was to fight for socialism in Britain. The meeting ran well over its appointed finishing time due to the discussion and questions asked by the audience who were clearly very interested in the past, present and future of the Venezuelan Revolution and in the on-going struggle. We left with a very clear view of how the media is being used as a weapon by the ruling class to deceive the working masses, and with a determination to step up the campaign in defence of the Venezuelan Revolution and to fight for socialism.",NA,NA

													HoV London","On April 11, 2002, an undemocratic coup in Venezuela, organised by the oligarchy with the backing of US imperialism, removed the democratically elected government and kidnapped the president Hugo Chavez. In less than 48 hours and despite the media manipulation, the Bolivarian masses had come out on the streets, defeated the coup and reinstated their president. 10 years later, as part of a series of events to celebrate the people's victory against the coup, Hands Off Venezuela is hosting the London premiere of ""Cuarto Poder"" (the Fourth Power) a new documentary examining the role of media, media monopoly and ownership, media manipulation and related issues with special reference to the media coverage of events in Venezuela. The documentary, by Pablo Roldán and Míriam Díaz-Crespo is in Spanish with English subtitles. It has received a joint prize to the best documentary by a young team at the Santiago de Cuba Festival, and has also featured at the Documentasur Festival in Getafe, Spain, the 2nd International Festival of Independent Political Films in Buenos Aires and the International Human Rights Festival Document9 in Glasgow. (Spanish trailer here: http://vimeo.com/25357758 ) John McDonnell MP and Alan Woods will speak on the importance of the Bolivarian revolution and there will be plenty of time for discussion.

Free to members, or join on the day, and hear speakers coming from Venezuela as well as debate and wider discussion in solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. We have now confirmed the speaker from Venezuela: Julio Bañez , a Caracas firefighter, heavily involved in the relief efforts for the flood victims in December 2010, revolutionary activist of the Socialist United Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and part of an attempt to set up a Firefighters Union. The flood relief efforts in Bolivarian Venezuela included the government requisitioning empty flats and empty hotel rooms to temporarily house those affected, some where also temporarily lodged in ministries and even the Miraflores presidential palace. Also speaking will be John McDonnell, MP , the Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada , Alan Woods , Jeremy Dear (National Union of Journalists) and others. We will have a session on what lessons can be learnt from the revolutionary movements in Latin America for the struggle against cuts in Britain, with speakers from the Latin American Coordination Against Cuts ( COLACOR ) and the Latin American Workers Association ( LAWAS ). On the same day of our conference, a picket has been called against Alvaro Uribe (former Colombian president) who will be speaking at a meeting of ""investors"" (read looters). As soon as we finish the conference we plan to go together and join this action, as Uribe was prominent in all the attempts to destroy the Venezuelan revolution while he was in power.

As a result, it has earned the wrath of Washington and the local oligarchy who organised several attempts to remove the democratically elected president Hugo Chavez through military coup, economic sabotage, bosses lock out, etc. The September 26, 2010 elections gave the Socialist United Party of Venezuela (PSUV) a renewed majority in the National Assembly, but with a reduced vote. Next year's presidential elections will be crucial for the future of the revolution. Come and hear more about Venezuela's revolution. Speakers from Venezuela and Britain.

													Hands Off Venezuela","The Hands Off Venezuela Britain national conference 2011 was a success, with some fifty delegates packed into the room at London’s ULU to hear speakers from Britain and Venezuela. Passport issues meant that Venezuelan firefighter and trade unionist Julio Bañez got stuck in Madrid on his way to London, but he still managed to speak at the conference via a webcam! He began by thanking everyone for their solidarity with Venezuela, and denounced the recent opposition student protests and hunger strikes in Venezuela, whose real aim was to agitate the right wing. He then spoke of the issue of workers’ control in Venezuela. Some occupations have been successful, some not, and some elements of the bureaucracy are part of the problem. This was seen in a recent march on the National Assembly, demanding an end to legal proceedings against workers involved in occupations. This is one of the contradictions of the Bolivarian revolution – help is officially offered in some quarters, then blocked in others. The struggle continues, but progress is being made. Venezuelan ambassador to the UK Samuel Moncada then spoke. He said that the Venezuelan process is an ongoing one, and no-one knows what the outcome will be. Sometimes mistakes are made, but what is undeniable is the participation of the people, and the fact that they are the driving force. Addressing the housing crisis, he said that some 2 million hectare of land have been nationalised by the Chávez government and large amounts of idle land in cities is also being expropriated. With presidential elections next year, inflation is an issue which the fascist opposition is keen to exploit, something that needs tackling. The US National Endowment for Democracy has given millions to the Venezuelan opposition, but the opposition is so corrupt that the NED has actually been asking for its money back as it doesn’t know how it was spent! Next to speak was Gabriela Quevedo from the Latin American Workers Association (LAWAS). She explained why the association was needed – there are some 113,500 Latinos in London, 186,500 in the UK, and 85% are employed. They are highly educated, often vastly overqualified for their jobs. Over 40% have experienced abuse in the workplace, and 11% work below the minimum wage, which is of course illegal. LAWAS helps workers unionise, organises collective action and raises awareness about workers’ rights. Solidarity campaigns such as HOV link migrant struggles in the UK with the struggles in Latin America. John McDonnell MP, HOV Honorary President, took time out from his busy schedule to speak. He spoke of the upcoming strike on 30 th June, and the fears the ConDem government has of direct action. The UK movement could learn lessons on mobilisation from Venezuela, he said. There is a need to lift people’s aspirations to see what could be. We need to bring this government down, he declared, but build a socialist alternative at the same time. What would be the point of removing the government and replacing it with New Labour? Venezuela is a shining example of what can be done with mass participation. Following on from discussion about cuts in the UK, Amada Silva from the Golden Years Latin American day centre in Lambeth then spoke. The centre is a place for elderly Latinos in London to socialise and meet other people, but like so much in this country is under threat of closure after the council cut funding. Just another example of the cuts we have to fight against, and the link between the struggle in this country and the struggles in Latin America. After a lively question an answer session, and votes on resolutions ( see full list of resolutions passed here ), most delegates then headed over to Baker Street to join in a picket against murderous former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, who was speak at the London Business School. The picket was very noisy and well attended, and sent a clear message that Uribe will be held accountable for his crimes! Picture Gallery : ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Sunday, November 7, the Minneapolis/St. Paul chapter of Hands Off Venezuela participated in an event at the Walker Community Church in Minneapolis focusing on the attempted coup in Ecuador. The event was organized by Hands Off Honduras and had several speakers, including John Peterson, National Secretary of the HOV campaign, and Marcial Castro, a local activist with the Hands Off Honduras coalition. Around 40 people attended the event, which also featured Silvia Ontaneda, Consul of Ecuador to Minnesota. Silvia introduced the event, giving a broad historical overview of Ecuador's political history, which is one interspersed with repeated coups in the interest of US imperialism. This is a pattern all too familiar in the region. She explained the details of the coup attempt, e.g. the way that the police officers were misled and lied to about reforms instituted by the Correa government, and the heroic resistance of the masses to yet another ousting of a democratically elected president. John's presentation focused on a history of the revolutionary process in Venezuela, connecting this to the general process of revolution across Latin America. He explained the reasons why US imperialism views the revolutionary movement in Latin America, in its various stages of development in different countries, as a mortal threat to its power in the region and the world, but also how the masses have shown a heroic willingness to fight back against these coups.",NA,NA

			HOV Conference 2011 resolutions",2011-05-23T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","The British Hands Off Venezuela campaign, held its national conference 2011 on May 21st in London . These are the resolutions which were discussed and passed unanimously and also the list of the elected steering committee. 1. On Libya and misinformation The Hands Off Venezuela campaign condemns the recent smear campaign against Venezuela by Conservative politicians, especially William Hague, and certain media outlets in the UK, consisting of spreading false information that Colonel Gaddafi had fled from Libya to Venezuela. The cynical purpose of this lie was to label President Chavez “guilty by association” with Gaddafi. It is very revealing that the right-wing media and politicians in Britain which denigrate Venezuela as a “dictatorship” hardly had a word of criticism of the rulers of Tunisia and Egypt until their overthrow was imminent. Even worse, Gaddafi’s forces are now killing fellow Libyans with weapons sold to them by the UK and other western countries just as did Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia. We reiterate that far from being a “dictatorship” President Chavez and the Bolivarian movement have consistently demonstrated that in one election after another they have had majority support from the people of Venezuela. Hands Off Venezuela applauds and welcomes the recent and continuing uprising of the masses in many countries in North Africa and the Middle East against corrupt and dictatorial governments which have been tied politically and economically to multinational corporations and Imperialism. We welcome the overthrow of Ben Ali and Mubarak in Tunisia and Egypt respectively. We believe that these developments run parallel with the Bolivarian revolution. Indeed they are part of the same worldwide struggle for a fairer and better society as the demands of the masses in the Arab world have been both political; freedom of organisation, speech, assembly and elections and economic; for jobs, lower food prices and equality. Just as Hands Off Venezuela stands against imperialist intervention in Venezuela and Latin America, we are also against such intervention in Libya and elsewhere. 2. On the visit of Alvaro Uribe to London This Hands Off Venezuela conference notes that former Colombian president Uribe has been invited to speak in London by the London School of Business and the London School of Economics. The Uribe government presided over numerous abuses of human rights and attacks on trade union, peasant, student and community activists in Colombia. A common grave with 2,000 bodies was discovered at La Macarena, most likely, victims of the “false positive” police of the Colombian Army of killing innocent civilians and passing them as “guerrillas”. More than three thousand extra-judicial killings by the official state ‘security forces’ took place under Uribe. Uribe was a key player in all the Washington-organized provocations against the Venezuelan revolution during his presidency. He has given refuge to the leader of the 2002 Venezuelan coup against President Chavez, Pedro Carmona Estanga. In 2004, 130 Colombian paramilitaries were discovered in Venezuela plotting another coup attempt. In 2005 Colombian security forces illegally entered Venezuela and kidnapped Colombian national Rodrigo Granda in Caracas. According to Wikileaks cables, Uribe authorized the illegal infiltration of Colombian security forces into Venezuelan territory. For all these and many other reasons: 3. On the arrest of Joaquín Pérez Becerra This Hands Off Venezuela conference notes that Joaquín Pérez Becerra was detained in Caracas by the Venezuelan security forces on April 23 and then handed over to the Colombian authorities as there was an Interpol red note against him. Pérez Becerra is a Colombian political refugee in Sweden who subsequently renounced to his Colombian nationality and acquired Swedish citizenship. He fled Colombia in fear of his life in the 1990s, when he was a local councillor for the Union Patriotica party. Two UP presidential candidates, eight UP congressmen, 11 UP mayors, 13 UP deputies, 70 UP councilmen, and up to 5,000 UP activists were killed in the 1990s in Colombia in an attempt to eradicate the party. In Sweden, Pérez Becerra became the editor of the ANNCOL news agency and website. The Colombian government is well known for its violations of human rights, persecution and extra judicial killing of political opponents, etc. The alleged proof of Perez Becerra’s role in the FARC guerrillas which is the basis for the case against him was obtained from the laptop computer of FARC leader Raul Reyes. An expert report by the Interpol itself recognized that ""Access to the data contained in the eight FARC computer exhibits...did not conform to internationally recognized principles for handling electronic evidence by law enforcement.""The killing of Raul Reyes and seizure of the said laptop took place during an illegal incursion of Colombian armed forces into Ecuadorean territory. The Colombian Supreme Court has now ruled that all evidence obtained as a result is “inadmissible in court”. The fact that Joaquín Pérez Becerra was allowed to board a plane from Frankfurt to Caracas despite the fact that there was an Interpol red note against him suggests that the whole operation was designed to cause maximum embarrassment for the Venezuelan government and accuse it of “supporting FARC terrorists”. However, we think it was a serious mistake for the Venezuelan authorities to hand him over to the Colombian authorities, particularly considering the appalling record in regard to human rights. This has damaged the image of the Venezuelan revolution amongst its supporters in Venezuela and abroad and will not serve to prevent the continuation of the campaign of lies and slanders against the Bolivarian revolution. This has been clearly shown by the publication of Raul Reyes laptop files by the London based International Institute of Strategic Studies. Therefore, - We reject the constant campaign of provocations on the part of the Colombian authorities against the Venezuelan revolution - We reject the handing over of Pérez Becerra to the Colombian authorities - We call on the Venezuelan authorities to put pressure on Colombia to guarantee that Perez Becerra’s rights are respected - We call on the Swedish authorities to provide full help and legal assistance to Perez Becerra as a Swedish national and to put pressure on the Colombian authorities to achieve his release - We reject the renewed campaign of lies against the Bolivarian revolution around the so-called “Raul Reyes laptop files” - We demand the release of Pérez Becerra - We reaffirm our solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution 4. On building solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution This Hands Off Venezuela conference condemns the continued hostility towards Venezuela from the United States, and condemns the illegal US government funding for opposition groups and parties in Venezuela, which has increased exponentially, reaching nearly $15 million annually from State Department agencies alone in the 9 years since the 2002 coup. Conference also notes with alarm the increasingly aggressive and hysterical tone of attacks coming from the US Congress and Senate, including declarations that President Chávez is a terrorist and is seeking to obtain nuclear weapons. We do not believe the fact that presidential elections are approaching is a coincidence. Conference also condemns the report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the think tank behind the infamous Iraq dossier on weapons of mass destruction, that claims links between the Bolivarian government and FARC guerrillas, based on laptops from a FARC camp in Ecuadorian territory, when an Interpol report proved that thousands of files had been modified or deleted by the Colombian authorities. With Presidential elections next year, solidarity is urgently needed more than ever, and Conference calls upon everyone to increase their efforts to counter the lies and propaganda constantly thrown at the government of President Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution. 5. On the struggle against cuts in Britain and work with COLACOR The Hands off Venezuela conference is outraged by the vicious cuts being implemented by the ConDem government. This is the worst attack on the working class in living memory, decimating jobs and services. We note that this is in complete contrast with the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela, where increased investment in health, education, housing, and much more has transformed the lives of the country’s poor. We pledge to fight against these cuts and continue working within the Latin American Coalition Against Cuts (COLACOR). We note that whilst in Venezuela the most vulnerable in society have been empowered by the Bolivarian revolution, in Britain these cuts will hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest - women, the disabled, children, the elderly and immigrants. The effect on immigrants is likely to be compounded as they become victims of scape goating. We believe that we must avoid all attempts to divide us and that the British and immigrant working class must unite and fight these cuts. We note that the cuts and privatisations being forced upon us in Britain are part of a “neoliberal” agenda that was first tested on Latin America to disastrous consequences, creating extreme poverty and oppression for millions. We have seen in Latin America the affects of austerity, capitalism, privatisation, exploitation and enforced poverty, but we have also seen how popular uprising can bring down governments, defeat corporations and restore power to the people. Those who refuse to forget are compelled to support the new revolutionary governments in Latin America and to fight the destructive policies of the current British government This is only the beginning. We will continue to mobilise against the cuts, alongside the other members of COLACOR, by building a movement that not only challenges the cuts but defeats them. We must organize, resist, unite, and fight. We have to throw everything we have at this government of the rich, including a general strike. We will fight hasta la victoria siempre !

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Saturday September 18, some 40 people attended the London branch of Hands Off Venezuela’s vibrant rally in solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. An international day of solidarity had been called by the Venezuelan branch of HOV and the Bolivarian People’s Congress in light of the upcoming National Assembly elections. In 2005 opposition parties did not contest the Assembly elections as they knew they were facing a massive defeat. This time they are looking to gain ground in elections to be held on September 26, so it is important for us to show the people of Venezuela that there is huge support around the world for their peaceful and democratic revolution. The rally was held in glorious sunshine outside the Houses of Parliament – the very heart of British imperialism, and was attended by a diverse range of people including students, workers, youth and political activists, as well as the wider Latin American community. The rally attracted a great deal of interest from the passing public, who were generally either under-informed or misinformed about the Venezuela process and hundreds of Hands Off Venezuela newsletters detailing the significance of the upcoming elections were distributed. Participants were encouraged to write messages of solidarity to the Venezuelan people, and have their photograph taken alongside the message (see photos). With speeches, music and even a cappella hip hop in honour of Venezuela, and a diverse crowd, the event was a resounding success.

													HoV Canada","Toronto | Vancouver | Montreal Hands Off Venezuela and the Toronto Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel” organized a very successful meeting in defence of the gains of the Venezuelan Revolution, in advance of the critical National Assembly elections on 26 th September, as part of an international day of action organized by the international HOV campaign. Even though there were a number of other political and social events going on in Toronto at the same time, over 30 people turned out at the OISE building, located on the University of Toronto campus. The crowd was mainly made up of young people with very diverse backgrounds, showing the wide interest that exists in ensuring that the Venezuelan Revolution is successful. We received very warm greetings of support from Marta Prado and Aura Maria Suarez, the Consul-General and Deputy Consul of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in Toronto, as well as from Jorge Sorberon, the Consul-General of Cuba in Toronto. All three were extremely thankful for the support of the attendees for attending the event and being such staunch defenders of the revolutionary movements of Latin America. As well, we received greetings from James Cockcroft, a noted author who has just released a book on the Mexican Revolution, who was visiting from Montreal. The two featured speakers were Maria Paez Victor and Camilo Cahis, both members of HOV and the Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel.” Maria began her presentation by going over some of the fantastic successes of the Venezuelan Revolution and the difference this has made in the lives of millions of working class and poor people in the country. She further commented on how the international corporate press has, in an incredibly scandalous manner, lied and manipulated the news coming out of Venezuela. Maria read out a few excerpts from recent articles in the Economist magazine and in the Globe and Mail . Both publications lamented the so-called “loss of democracy” in Venezuela, and that Venezuela and Cuba were supposedly countering the spread of openness and accountability being seen in other Latin American countries. The op-ed piece in the Globe and Mail mentioned how there needs to be a greater effort on the part of Latin American governments to combat poverty and inequality—without mentioning that this is exactly what has been done in Venezuela! Instead, the international press prefers to use the same criminal language as the right-wing opposition in Venezuela, such as labelling President Chávez a “mad man.” Camilo then spoke about the importance of both the Venezuelan Revolution and the National Assembly elections to the global working class movement. In this current period where governments are demanding that workers pay for the crisis of capitalism, Venezuela alone is going against this current. For this reason, it is vitally important for the imperialists to demonize the successes of the revolution, so that it doesn’t become a beacon for workers around the world. The imperialists and their puppet, former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, failed in their efforts to destabilize Venezuela this past summer and thus, see their best chances at destroying the revolution by gaining a majority in the National Assembly elections. Camilo mentioned that it was vital for Hands Off Venezuela to have mobilized this international day of action, to show the Venezuelan masses that they are not alone in their struggle. Furthermore, Camilo urged the attendees to inform their co-workers, classmates, friends, and family members about what was going on in Venezuela, and how a successful socialist revolution in Venezuela could open the door to similar successful revolutions across the world. Following the presentations, there was a lively question and answer period, including a discussion about the role of foreign diplomacy for Venezuela, especially in terms of relations with Iran. Everyone was quite excited to hear Maria speak about the positive news that appeared to be coming from Venezuela—that the opposition was in disarray and that the PSUV was fighting valiantly in the election campaign. Alex Grant from HOV noted that the fact that there hasn’t been as much anti-Venezuela propaganda in the media may suggest that the opposition will do very badly in the National Assembly elections. There was an incredible sense of camaraderie among the event attendees, knowing that this event was only one of dozens around the world, held to support the victory of the PSUV in the upcoming elections and held to defend the Venezuelan Revolution. Everyone left feeling determined to do their utmost to spread news about the gains of the revolution, and working at building the workers’ and youth movement at home. Toronto | Vancouver | Montreal As part of the International Day of Action to support the Bolivarian revolution in the upcoming parliamentary elections an excellent discussion was organized by Hands Off Venezuela and the Vancouver Bolivarian Society. Held at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, with the support of the UBC Social Justice Center, 10 people gathered to discuss the Venezuelan revolution, its importance to the international struggle for socialism, and the significance of the coming elections. Initial remarks were given by Mike Palacek, recording secretary for the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (Vancouver local) and Western Canadian Co-ordinator of the Hands off Venezuela campaign; and Antonio Ortiz of the Vancouver Bolivarian Society. Mike spoke about the nature of the coming elections as a snapshot within a revolutionary process; rather like looking at a single frame in a film. This perspective connected with Antonio’s observation that the loss of a revolutionary majority of 2/3 would provide fertile ground for the counter- revolution to sabotage the fundamental gains of the revolution. The danger of media distortion by corporate, bourgeois, media sources has an effect on the consciousness of the masses who are fed scare stories about socialism. Mike pointed out that the revolution has persisted for 10 years and both made the observation that fundamentally the revolution has yet to conquer power by replacing the capitalist state. These remarks laid the foundation for a lively discussion about the nature of a mixed economy, drawing on observations of transitional types of economies in China and Cuba for illustration. It was generally agreed that capitalism provides no solution for the fundamental problems facing under developed nations, and that furthermore it was capitalism itself as a system of crisis which prevented the further development of the productive forces on an international scale. The gains of the Venezuelan revolution are an inspiration to progressive forces around the world. Antonio juxtaposed Venezuela, a comparatively under developed country, next to Canada, and drew a decisive line between the kind of society being built by the revolution and that which capitalism can provide for even in places like Canada. In Venezuela dramatic gains are being made in poverty reduction, education and health care; whereas in Canada these same historic gains of reformism are now being stripped away. Antonio pointed out the critically decisive importance of the elections of 26 September in the future course of the revolution, and the necessity of a parliamentary majority to continue the revolutionary process really initiated as far back as the Caracazo in 1989. The danger of counter revolution lurks both in plain sight and in the shadows; and will not hesitate to strike when it sees the opportunity. Mike pointed out the military option was likely off the table for the counter revolution, and that a parliamentary coup such as was seen with the ouster of Manuel Zelaya in Honduras is a more likely option. Antonio also expanded upon this describing the coup as legitimized in the eyes of the world due to the recognition of the Lobo regime, and in the event of a loss of the revolutionary majority in the National Assembly on September 26 ripe conditions for a similar action by the counter- revolutionary forces in Venezuela could develop, particularly in the absence of an international response to defend the revolution. The importance of International solidarity and the victory of socialism in the Bolivarian revolution were the conclusions of the discussion. The importance of the revolution to the cause of labour cannot be overstated and the elections of the 26 will have international implications. The gathered participants came away with a deepened understanding of the current situation in Venezuela, its importance, and a commitment to continue building for socialism and in defence of the revolution; on the campus, and in the workplaces, unions and political parties where workers and their families turn to defend their cause. Toronto | Vancouver | Montreal On Sunday September 19th, ""La Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela (SBQ/HOV) held a discussion about the up coming Venezuelan elections on September 26th. This was part of an international day of action organized by the international HOV campaign. Close to 20 people turned out for the discussion that was held at the Bolivarian Cultural centre in downtown Montreal. The event was introduced by HOV/SBQ president Stéphanie Vaudry, who welcomed everyone to the discussion and stressed the importance of the elections and the event as a part of the international day of action. She then introduced the Cónsul General of Montreal, Lesbia Margarita Morales Castillo who explained the importance of these elections and that it was not just important for Venezuela but for the entire world because it is an international movement. After the consul spoke, Isa Al-Jaza’iri from HOV/SBQ introduced an in depth discussion about the dangers facing the Venezuelan revolution. He covered the hypocritical destabilization campaign organized by the imperialists and their local office boys in Venezuela. He also talked about how the danger was not just electoral. With US military bases being constructed in a number of countries in Latin America and the latest provocations involving Columbia, the threat of military intervention and very real. He stressed the negative, demoralizing effects that a victory for the right wing in Venezuela could have for the entire continent and the movement for the whole world. With a victory for the oligarchy in Venezuela, the rightwing will become strengthened all over the world. He then moved on to talk about what was the way forward. He stressed again that this was an international movement. It is important for the workers and youth of every country to unite together to struggle against their imperialists to stop imperialist war and to end the raping and pillaging of Latin America for resources and cheap labour. He stressed the importance of taking the main levers of the economy out of the hands of the capitalists and running the economy democratically. After the presentation, the discussion started. A number of people intervened about the military bases, nationalization of industry, the media campaign against the revolution about cuba and the movement in the whole continent. The dangers of bureaucracy were talked about at length. It was stressed that a victory for the PSUV was absolutely necessary but that bureaucracy within the bolivarian movement was causing major problems and strangling the revolution. One participant was excited that the group had organized the discussion and proposed that we organize more discussion on many different topics pertaining to the revolution in Latin America. It was announced that the group would be holding a social to watch the election results come in and have drinks and food.

Then he explained the process with which the election of deputies to the National Assembly takes place, saying that the future of the revolution depends upon the outcome of these elections. In conclusion, Gonzalez also emphasized the importance of developing this event in Rio de Janeiro, showing the solidarity of the Brazilian people with the Venezuelan political system . The event included the presence and participation of teachers, students, journalists and supporters of the Venezuelan revolution.

The motion to support the Hands Off Venezuela campaign was moved by a delegate from the Gotcha workers, a group of female textile workers who have occupied their factory and are trying to run it under workers' control. The campaign had a big impact in Venezuela itself where it was featured in news reports in the main newspapers and TV stations. A full page article detailing the activities of the campaign and thanking it for its international solidarity appeared in Ultimas Noticias on Saturday 25.

In 18 countries hundreds of workers and youth gathered in meetings and other activities to discuss the upcoming elections and spread information about the revolution. Here are a reports from Greece, Belgium, USA and El Salvador with pictures. Greece | Belgium | USA | El Salvador | Picture gallery Yesterday a delegation of the Greek Ηands Off Venezuela Campaign visited the Venezuelan Embassy in Athens to hand over the Statement in support of the Bolivarian revolution in the forthcoming elections in Venezuela. This Statement was signed by some very well-known and important political leaders of the Greek Left. Among them are the President of SYNASPISMOS, Alexis Tsipras, the left PASOK MP, Sofia Sakorafa, the ex-President of SYNASPISMOS Alekos Alavanos, the candidate for the Presidency of the Athens Region for the forthcoming Regional Elections, Alexis Mitropoulos, the well-known left poet Nadia Valavani and many others. The Ambassador of Venezuela in Greece, Rodrigo Chavez thanked the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, and spoke enthusiastically about its activities in defence of the Bolivarian Revolution, mentioning in particular the leading figure of the campaign comrade Alan Woods. He promised the delegation any kind of help it may need for the public activities of HOV in Greece. The statement of HOV in support of the Bolivarian Revolution has also become very well-known inside the Greek Left in general and has been republished on many Left websites. Through this action, once again HOV has demonstrated that is the most active campaign in Greece in defence of the Bolivarian and Latin American revolution in general. The Greek HOV Campaign is planning for the next period a series of activities, starting with a presence in the Synaspismos Youth Festival in the early days of October. LONG LIVE THE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY! LONG LIVE THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION! Greece | Belgium | USA | El Salvador | Picture gallery Some 30 belgian and latinoamerican activists met in solidarity with the revolution in Venezuela. They represented organisations like Hands Off Venezuela, the Colectivo Rodrigista, the Comabe and the Collectif Venezuela 13 avril. Also present were some youth who visited the revolution as part of the first Solidarity Youth Brigade this summer. We distributed leaflets to passers-by in the centre of the city. Not accidentally we met in front of the symbol of capitalism, the Brussels Stock-Exchange. In the leaflet we gave the reasons we supported the revolution. The press department of the Venezuelan embassy filmed our activity and made some interviews. Next week we will make a last effort within the workers and left movement to explain the need for solidarity. Viva la Revolucion ! Ni un paso atras ! Greece | Belgium | USA | El Salvador | Picture gallery On Friday, September 17th, Twin Cities Hands Off Venezuela hosted a discussion on the Venezuelan Revolution at Mayday Books in Minneapolis, with a focus on the upcoming parliamentary elections. John Peterson, National Secretary of US HOV, introduced the discussion by giving an overview of the history of the revolution since the 1989 caracazo , highlighting the different stages and successes of the revolution, and its importance as an inspiring example of ordinary people taking their destinies into their own hands, not only for the Latin America, but for the world. A map was used to illustrate the manner in which US imperialism has been surrounding the country with military bases, in a clear attempt to isolate it and eventually justify an invasion or proxy war, most likely through Colombia. He also pointed out the problems facing the revolution and the contradictions that remain, namely, the continued existence of capitalism and a state apparatus and bureaucracy designed to defend private property of the means of production. He explained that you cannot make half a revolution. Either the revolution is completed on a socialist basis, meaning that direct, participatory democracy is introduced, as opposed to the existing parliamentary form of government; and also on the economic plane, the key factories, banks, and land must be nationalized and put under the democratic control of the workers and peasants, or the counter-revolution will succeed in rolling back all the gains of the revolution in a vicious manner. In addition to this, he explained the need for the revolution to spread internationally, as there is no solution to the contradictions of capitalism within the limits of any one state. The September 26th elections and their aftermath are set to be another key point of inflection in the revolutionary process, as the forces of revolution and counter-revolution confront each other once again on the political plane -- and on the streets, in the factories, the universities, and the barracks. There was a lively discussion, including one student who had lived in Venezuela sharing her thoughts on her experiences of the contradictions and polarization in the country. The balance sheet of the discussion was that while there are indeed many problems that remain, such as inflation, dependence on food imports, crime and corruption, there is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater: the revolution must go forward and be completed on the lines outlined above. We will follow up this meeting with an election night fundraiser to monitor the elections and discuss informally, on the evening of September 26th in NE Minneapolis.

Greece | Belgium | USA | El Salvador | Picture gallery Friday, September 17. A delegation from the Popular Youth Block (BPJ) visited the Venezuelan Embassy to show support for Venezuela’s United Socialist Party (PSUV), which is standing in the September 26 elections. In this meeting, we emphasized the need to keep going moving forward and deepen the actual revolutionary process. We talked about the experiences of workers’ control and the lessons we must draw from the bourgeoisie’s economic sabotage against the Venezuelan Government. This delegation was well received by the Embassy, because they know of the efforts of HoV in several countries, trying to unmask the ambitions of the bourgeoisie and its intervention in the mass media, where they impose their point of view about a process, which is lived and fought for in the streets by the Bolivarian people. Among the revolution’s achievements, we can list the international missions. Wladimir Ruiz Tirado, the Business Council in El Salvador, told us that in this country there is the Milagro Mission, which covers another 33 countries. From El Salvador alone, there have been already 52 trips to Venezuela by poor people to have their eyes operated on. There are 4000 surgeries in El Salvador, plus another 4,000 run by Cuba, all of them, sponsored by the same Mission. Every six weeks there is a medical delegation that goes to Venezuela to attend and help Venezuelan people free of charge, and the same Mission also provides drugs. Also there are 160 scholarship students who study Engineering, Medicine, Sports, and other subjects. Cultura Mission supports artistic projects, and also cultural heritage recovery. Finally, there’s the most successful project, known as ALBA-petróleos. This project, aims to get 450,000 barrels of oil, turbogas and propane gas, which is going to be distributed at a cheap price and will be relief for working class families in El Salvador. This project is going to fund loans at a 1% interest rate to projects (some of them have already begun). The BPJ, the El Salvadorian section of the IMT, and member of the HoV Campaign, supports all these projects which are the result of nationalised oil production. They also show us the potential of the whole economy if it were run under democratic workers’ management. It is because of this, that we support the PSUV candidates to the National Assembly and we are expecting these results to give a bold example of how a revolution can be carried out, by keeping this process alive and expropriating the bourgeoisie and moving forward to Socialism.

A solidarity rally will be taking place in London opposite the Houses of Parliament on Saturday 18th at 3pm and actions will be taking place in at least another 18 countries around the world, from Greece, Canada and the United States to Colombia, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina. This will be the 15th electoral process in Venezuela since 1998, every one of which has been verified as free and fair by international and impartial observers, and a recent study showed how election adverts for opposition candidates has dominated Venezuelan TV during initial days of campaigning with 75.4% of the total adverts shown in support of them. Despite this, the international media will try and paint a picture so remote from the truth it's hard to call it journalism. The Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK writes with more detail in the latest edition of the Hands Off Venezuela newsletter how the credentials of real democracy Venezuela are clear to see. However, due to the opposition candidates in Venezuela making a big mistake during the last National Assembly elections in 2005 by boycotting them completely, it should be expected that opposition candidates gain more seats than last time just be staying in the race. Now is the time to make our voices heard loud and relayed back to the people of Venezuela. Hands Off Venezuela calls on all supporters around the world of the peaceful and democratic revolution in Venezuela to join in the actions planned and to be aware that a significant gain for the U.S funded opposition groups would only harm the revolution. It is within this context that international solidarity at this point is so important.

													HoV Denmark","The book has been published with support from the Venezuelan embassy in Copenhagen, the Marxist paper Socialistisk Standpunkt and the trade unions 3F Esbjerg and LFS. The author has been on a nationwide tour to present the book and last but not least to discuss the Venezuelan Revolution, the elections and the way forward. The book was officially launched on Monday September 6, at a reception organised by the embassy and HoV, at the Venezuelan embassy, with 60 people present, from other embassies, the Danish left wing etc. All the guests were welcomed by the video on the elections. After the video the Venezuelan Charge d’affairs in Denmark, Roger Corbacho welcomed all to the reception. He thanked the author of the book and Hands Off Venezuela, Denmark, which he described as one of the progressive movements in Denmark. He explained the social progress as eradicating analfabetism by the ten years of revolution. The book was according to the Venezuelan tradition properly ”baptised” with flower leaves spread over the cover of the book. Andreas Bülow was then given the word and he explained how he was convinced of the necessity to write the book, when he saw the smear campaigns launched in the international and Danish press against the revolution, and when he discovered nothing had been written in Danish. He answered the lies from the media that there is no freedom of speech in Venezuela. Quite the opposite he said. Like Roger Corbacho, Andreas also explained how the revolution has meant social progress for the Venezuelan people in health, education etc. But he also explained that there are some problems in Venezuela. There is a sabotage of the economy from the opposition, who wants to destroy the revolution through their ownership over the media and economy. They hope by this to create indifference in the Venezuelan people towards the revolution and by this advance in the upcoming elections. According to Andreas this is the most pressing problem to be addressed now in Venezuela, that a small oligarchy despite tens years of revolution still owns and controls the most important parts of the economy. There is a danger that the Venezuelan masses in the end only sees ”socialism” as words, and not as something that makes their lives better. It is necessary for the revolution to take decisive steps towards socialism not just in words but in deeds and take control over the means of production in order to make a democratic plan for developing the economy and benefiting the large majority of Venezuelan people. This was the main line also explained at the other meetings in the book tour that is still going on. The campaign has so far visited a school with 100 students participating, Copenhagen university and Roskilde University with approximately 20 participants at each meetings, in the other part of Denmark, Jutland, in the two cities Aarhus and Aalborg, were there was a very great interest in the book, the revolution and the campaign. Yesterday there was a meeting at a technical high school and an open meeting in the city Roskilde. The book launch and the speaking tour has gotten a wide press coverage in Denmark and also in the Venezuelan state media. The only left-paper, Daily Worker is reproducing large extracts from one of the books ten chapters . Modkraft.dk, a well-known left-wing internet website with around 1.800 unique visitors every day, also reproduced the whole of chapter one . Also the Venezuelan state media reported on the Book launch. Articles appeared in Agencia Venezolana de Noticias , Radio YVKE Mundial , Librerias del Sur and Radio Nacional de Venezuela . Also the Spanish-language paper published by Latin immigrants in Sweden, Liberación carried a report of the event . Next week there will be more meetings and the tour will be closed by a panel debate on the perspectives for Latin American revolution and socialism in the 21 century with Andreas Bülow in the panel with Trine Mach, candidate for parliament from the Socialist Peoples party (SF) and Flavia Oregon from the Unity List. So far almost 100 copies of the book have been sold and about 250 in total has so far attended the public meetings.

													Hands Off Venezuela","The National Assembly elections in Venezuela, which will take place on September 26, will mark a turning point for the Bolivarian revolution. What is at stake is not only who will have a majority in the National Assembly, but the future of the revolutionary process itself. The Bolivarian Revolution has sunk deep roots among the Venezuelan people. The conquests it has achieved for workers and peasants, for the poorest layers in the cities and in the countryside, are well known: in the fields of education, health care, the development of basic infrastructures, state control over strategic industries, and the beginning of an agrarian reform. The example of Venezuela has inspired workers, peasants and the people of Latin America and the world in their struggle against imperialist domination, poverty and exploitation. But the Bolivarian Revolution has also unleashed the wrath of US imperialism and its allies in the Venezuelan oligarchy, who see these social conquests as a threat to the interests of the rich and powerful. They have used all means at their disposal to undermine the aims and achievements of the revolution: through international diplomatic pressure, a constant media campaign of lies and slander, attempts to sabotage the Venezuelan economy, not to mention several coup attempts and plots. If the forces of the right wing and reaction gain a sizable presence in the National Assembly, there is no doubt that they will use it as a weapon to block or reverse the progressive measures taken so far, and as a focal point to stall the advance of the revolution. They are already doing this in Venezuela, and the same can be seen in countries like Honduras, Bolivia and Ecuador, and in the past, in Nicaragua and Chile. A defeat of the Venezuelan revolution would be used against all those around the world who suffer the domination and the oppression of the powerful, and who struggle for a better world. It would encourage the reactionary political forces in every country to intensify their right-wing policies, and aid in their efforts to weaken and demoralize those who oppose them. For these reasons, it is now more necessary than ever for all progressive forces in society – the workers, the urban and rural poor, the youth, the intellectuals and professionals who are committed to the cause of the people – to unite their voices and efforts, in Latin America and throughout the world, to defend the Bolivarian revolution, showcase its achievements, and denounce the forces of reaction that are trying to put an end to it. The National Assembly elections of September 26 will be an important milestone in this struggle of living forces between progress and reaction, between the future and the past. We therefore give our full solidarity and support to the Bolivarian candidates of the PSUV and make an appeal to the Venezuelan people to support them with their vote. We, the undersigned, appeal to all those in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution to redouble their activities in the coming weeks, to fight against the campaign of lies and misinformation of the media, and to publicise the achievements of the Bolivarian movement. We also aim to build solidarity links between the revolutionary people of Venezuela and their brothers and sisters in other countries, in order to defend the revolution against both its internal and external enemies. Together with the Bolivarian Congress of the Peoples in Venezuela, we call for the organisation of solidarity actions throughout the world on September 17 and 18, on the eve of elections.

			Honduras: one year from the coup - solidarity pickets",2010-06-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","(EN ESPAÑOL ABAJO) A small but militant picket gathered outside the Honduras embassy in London on June 28, 2010, to mark the first anniversary of the military coup and show our solidarity with the people's resistance. Similar actions took place in other parts of the world. The picket had been called by the Coordinadora Latinoamericana (which includes organisations like the Hands off Venezuela Campaign, the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign, Movement of Ecuadoreans in the UK and others), and included comrades from Chile, Perú, Colombia amongst others. A number of comrades spoke explaining how on June 28th last year, the democratically elected president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, was taken by the Army, put on a plane and sent to Costa Rica. The military coup, organised with the knowledge of the US embassy and the support of the local oligarchy, installed Roberto Micheletti in power. Several speakers explained how the 30 families of the Honduran oligarchy, which have run the country as their private fiefdom for decades, in conjunction with US imperialism, were too afraid to allow the people to have a real say about the running of the country and chose to do away with the façade of democracy which existed. The coup unleashed an extraordinary movement of peoples' resistance, with strikes, marches and organisation which has transformed the consciousness of the people. It is now clear to millions: the oligarchy and imperialism are the obstacle that needs to be removed in order to achieve real democracy, where the people can control the country's resources in the benefit of all. Amongst shouts of ""Lobo, Lobo, Lobo - out, out out!"" the symbol of the National Front of Peoples Resistance, which includes a silhouette of Morazan, the country's liberator, was hang from the main door of the embassy. The message was clear: we are in solidarity with the Honduran resistance - we do not recognise the illegitimate government of Porfirio Lobo - we want genuine democracy and a Constituent Assembly. Similar actions were taken in different parts of the world (including Finland) and we will publish further reports as they arrive.

Ahora está claro para millones de personas: la oligarquía y el imperialismo son el obstáculo a eliminar para conseguir una democracia auténtica, en la que el pueblo controle los recursos del país en beneficio de la mayoría, no de las 30 familias de la oligarquía. Entre gritos de ""Lobo, Lobo, Lobo, Fuera Fuera Fuera!"", el símbolo del FNPR, que incluye una silueta de Morazán, el libertador centroamericano, colgó de la puerta principal de la embajada. El mensaje era claro: nos solidarizamos con la lucha del pueblo hondureño en resistencia - no reconocemos al gobierno ilegítimo de Porfirio Lobo - queremos una auténtica democracia con una Asamblea Constituyente. También tenemos notícias de otras manifestaciones en otras partes del mundo (incluyendo en Finlandia) e iremos publicando reportes en cuanto nos lleguen.

													Hands Off Venezuela","This allegations were made at a meeting of the Organisation of American States, but none of the alleged proof for this stands any serious scrutiny. We note that some of the alleged proof for this claims that the Venezuelan government is harbouring and supporting organisations which the US considers as ""terrorist"" come from the laptop of FARC leader Raul Reyes. This laptop was obtained by the Colombian army during an incursion into Ecuadorean territory, violating its national sovereignty. Also the Interpol at the time stated that no proper forensic procedures were followed in dealing with the laptop and therefore files could have been changed after the laptop was seized by the Colombian army. Other alleged evidence presented by the Colombian government is based on satellite images and pictures with no supporting evidence of where they are taken. This ""proof"" is as flimsy as the ""proof"" of the presence of Weapons of Mass Destruction which was used to justify the invasion of Iraq. We note that these claims are made against the background of increased military presence by the US in Colombia, the recent deployment of US military forces in Costa Rica, US support for the coup and the illegitimate government in Honduras, violation of Venezuelan airspace by US aircraft based in the Dutch colony of Curaçao, the reactivation of the US Navy's Fourth Fleet and constant statements by US officials against the democratically elected government of Venezuela. We note with concern that these allegations could serve to justify military action against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. We therefore express our continued support for the Bolivarian revolution and the people of Venezuela. We express our solidarity with the people of Colombia. We condemn the campaign of lies, slander and provocations on the part of the Colombian government. We reject imperialist interference on the part of the US administration in Latin America, by sponsoring coups, installing military bases and conducting military exercises. We demand that the democratic will of the Venezuelan people, who have elected president Hugo Chavez and supported the Bolivarian revolution in numerous occasions, should be respected.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","A group of about 40 activists protested outside the US embassy in London on Monday, June 13, demanding that Washington accepts the extradition request for Posada Carriles to Venezuela. Cuban-Venezuelan Luis Posada is wanted for blowing up an airliner in 1976, killing 73 people. He was arrested last month in the US, which is refusing to hand him over to Venezuela, where he escaped from jail. His partner in crime, Orlando Bosch, was given a presidential pardon by Bush the Elder and now lives in Miami, where they have named a street after him.  The protest picket, called jointly by Hands Off Venezuela, the Bolivian Solidarity Campaign and the Colombia Solidarity Campaign, also highlighted the hypocrisy of the US administration when it comes to dealing with ""terrorists"". In Colombia this year a total of seven US soldiers (including a colonel) have been arrested for, between them, selling ammunition to right-wing paramilitaries and attempting to smuggle cocaine into the US. Before the Colombian judiciary could blink, they were whisked out of the country to prevent further embarrassment and have not yet been charged with any crime.  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used to be President of Bolivia, before he ordered the massacre of peaceful protesters in 2003 and fled to Miami to escape the furious backlash. Bolivians want him tried for crimes against humanity, but that doesn't seem likely while he's protected by the US government, who immediately granted him political asylum.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","Some 50 activists participated in a very intense day of discussions during the Conference of Hands off Venezuela in London, on May 22. The main guests of the Conference were Katy Jaimes and Elías Chacón, active in the Socialist United Party (PSUV) and the PSUV youth as well as the movement of occupied factories, who had travelled from Venezuela to report on the current situation of the Bolivarian revolution. Katy Jaimes, a delegate to both the founding congress and the recently finished extraordinary congress of the PSUV, explained how the party’s aim was to be a tool “for the workers and by the workers” in order to fight for socialism. She explained how the party had initially got more than 7 million registered members (in a country of 27 million inhabitants) and how more than 2.5 million of those were participating actively and had voted in the election of the delegates to the party’s congress. She explained the achievements of the revolution in the fields of education, health care, the launching of the Simon Bolivar communications satellite and others, but stressed that the main conquest of the revolution was that “now we have a people which has awoken, has said enough is enough and taken its future into its own hands”. The opposition and the mass media internationally constantly attack Chavez for his role in the Bolivarian revolution, but Katy Jaimes made it clear that the revolutionary movement in Venezuela goes beyond the president and that as a matter of fact it started “in 1989 with a peoples’ uprising against the austerity package of Carlos Andres Perez”, the Caracazo . Following on from this, she reminded the audience of the austerity measures being planned by the new Conservative-Liberal government in Britain and asked them “what are you going to do about it? When are you going to start the British revolution!?”. Elías Chacón went on to explain the situation of the workers movement, including the mood of enthusiasm of the recent congress of the National Workers’ Union (UNT) which met in December 2009 and April 2010. Elías has been involved in the movement of the occupied factories, which he explained, shows in practice that the “workers can run the factories without bosses, and even improve the quality standards of production”, giving examples from INVEVAL (valve-making factory in Miranda), INAF (plumbing parts) and others. Chacón also explained how these factories were also facing the sabotage of the bureaucracy. In the case of INAF, for instance, president Chavez had decreed its nationalisation in a public broadcast last November, but this had not yet been implemented. He linked this to the call by president Chavez to do away with the bourgeois state which still exists in Venezuela. Finally, he also stressed that the struggle for socialism has to be international and how in this the role of the solidarity movement is crucial. We were also pleased to have Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada speaking in this session, with a presentation dealing with the outrageous campaign of media manipulation against Chavez and the Venezuelan revolution. This included not only the open and blatant lies of Fox News and others, but also the more subtle disinformation of “respectable” outlets like BBC News, he explained. Moncada explained how the United States has a long history of intervention in Latin America and how it is still today, a threat to the Bolivarian Revolution. He went into detail about the US military presence in the region, not only in Colombia, but also in the Dutch islands of Aruba and Curaçao, just off the coast of Venezuela. A lively question and answer session, showed the interest of the audience in the most recent developments of the revolution, including the question of the ownership of the means of production, the Bolivarian militia, etc. The morning session finished with a unanimous vote in favour of resolutions about the achievements of the Bolivarian revolution, against the threat of US intervention and in solidarity with the struggle of the occupied factories and demanding their nationalisation ( see text of the resolutions ). In the afternoon Conference reopened with a report from Roberto Navarrete, producer of “Inside the Revolution”, who explained the enormous interest there is in India for the Venezuelan Revolution and the call for a V International. The conference continued with a discussion with Alan Woods, editor of www.marxist.com , about Chávez’s call for the formation of a V International. He explained the importance of such a call, “the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union that the question of socialism has been put firmly on the table” and argued in favour of such an international, based, as Chavez had explained on the “struggle against capitalism, imperialism and for socialism”. Alan said that in his opinion, these were broad enough points on the basis of which revolutionaries could and should unite their efforts. He also added that there were forces, “bureaucrats and reformists”, which wanted to prevent it “from coming into being”. There was a lively discussion on this question, dealing with the question of whether it was possible to separate the struggle against capitalism from the struggle against imperialism, about the question of diplomatic and trade alliances of Venezuela with countries like Iran (“which is not a revolutionary regime, on the contrary, a counter-revolutionary one”, Alan explained), how would this new International look like, whether there was not a danger of it being taken over by bureaucrats from different countries rather than being a genuine revolutionary body, amongst others. Finally a resolution welcoming Chavez’s call for the V International and instructing the HOV committee to start discussions on this question within the campaign and in the wider labour movement was passed unanimously. Amancay Colque from the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign reported back from the Peoples’ Earth Summit in Cochabamba. She explained how Bolivian president Evo Morales had made it clear that “if capitalism lives Mother Earth dies”, linking clearly the struggle for the environment with the struggle against capitalism. Andy Higginbottom from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign reported back from the Enlazando Alternativas counter-summit to the EU – Latin America heads of state summit in Spain which he had attended the previous weekend. Andy stressed the role that European and particularly British multinationals play in the expoliation of third world countries, the destruction of the environment, attacks on trade union rights, etc. As a case example of this he highlighted the struggle of oil workers and the communities in Casanare, Colombia ( http://www.colombiasolidarity.org.uk/campaigns/19-bp/490-bp-in-casanare-workers-back-mobilisation-continues ). The discussion included many issues, including solidarity with the Resistance movement against the coup in Honduras which took place a year ago. Katrina Annis and José Sagaz explained the work of the Coordinadora Latinoamericana, the coalition of solidarity campaigns and Latin American workers’ groups, which HOV is a part of. Again, resolutions were voted on solidarity with Honduras, congratulating John McDonnell’s role in supporting Venezuela and supporting his bid for Labour Party leader, reaffirming the campaign’s work with the Coordinadora, and finally a new Steering Committee of the campaign was elected ( see resolutions and list of the Steering Committee members ) It was a very packed day, full of information and discussion and we would like to thank all those who participated and particularly all those who worked hard to make it happen.

													Hands Off Venezuela","As part of their visit to Britain in May 2010 to attend the Hands Off Venezuela conference, Venezuelan revolutionaries Katy Jaimes and Elias Chacón also spoke at fringe meetings at the conferences of the Public Commercial and Services Union in Brighton and the Communication Workers Union in Bournemouth. At PCS conference a motion had been submitted by the DEFRA Marine Fisheries Agency branch to disaffiliate from Hands Off Venezuela, on the grounds of alleged “increasing attacks on trade union activities in Venezuela”, amongst others. The movers of the resolution argued that “President Chavez was very anti-union, corrupt and undemocratic.” Hands Off Venezuela supporters in the PCS distributed a leaflet countering these unfounded claims and explaining the advances for workers that the Bolivarian revolution has meant. During the debate, Rob Williams, representing the union’s NEC opposed disaffiliation from Hands Off Venezuela, “because we strongly support trade union rights in Venezuela, as well as Iran and all over the world.” He called on the union to “support the Venezuelan people against the demands of the world’s bankers and multinationals - support their socialist transformation.” The motion was overwhelmingly defeated. Interestingly, a separate motion had been moved to PCS conference in support for Chavez’s call for a V International, even though this was not finally discussed. Just after this session there was a Hands Off Venezuela fringe meeting attended by about 20 delegates who listened to Katy Jaimes and Elias Chacón, both active in the Socialist United Party of Venezuela (PSUV), and asked many questions which had been raised during the debate. This shows the importance of the work of the campaign in countering the lies and disinformation of the media regarding what is really happening in Venezuela. At the end of the meeting Katy Jaimes asked the delegates present a question. “We’ve just read in the papers about the massive cuts proposed by the new Conservative-Liberal government”, she said. “Remember that the Venezuelan revolution started with the 1989 Caracazo uprising against the austerity package of Carlos Andres Perez,” she added, and asked the audience: “What are you going to do about it? Are you going to allow it to go through?” This showed in a clear way that the Venezuelan revolution can serve as an inspiration for the struggle of workers elsewhere. We would like to thank PCS for organizing the fringe meeting. At the CWU conference in Bournemouth Katy and Elias were able to address around 30 CWU delegates who attended the lunch time fringe meeting. Katy gave a short overview of the main achievements of the revolution while Elías concentrated on the development of the workers’ movement and the struggle for workers’ control and the occupied factories. The mood was very attentive andenthusiastic as the delegates heard about workers occupying factories and running them under workers’ control, as well as about the renationalization of privatized companies and the debate about how to get to socialism. In everybody’s minds was the threat of the new government to privatise Royal Mail. We hope that these meetings have served to inject a bit of the revolutionary spirit of the Venezuelan working people into the British trade union movement and we thank the different CWU branches who sponsored the meeting.

													Hands Off Venezuela","Resolutions on the achievements of the Bolivarian revolution This Hands Off Venezuela conference acknowledges the continued achievements of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in increasing the quality of life for all its citizens by moving away from the destructive capitalist model. Conference notes that poverty and inequality have continued to decrease in recent years and access to health care and the range of services available continues to expand. Conference is encouraged that enrolment rates in higher education have more than doubled and that solid steps to increase food sovereignty are being taken. This conference also supports all efforts to increase respect for women's rights, sexual diversity and the disabled, put an end to racial discrimination, and applauds the continued experiments in transferring power to the people and the call for not just a participatory democracy but one that is also protagonistic in nature. Resolution on US aggression against Venezuela This Hands Off Venezuela conference condemns the continued aggression towards Venezuela from the United States under the Presidency of Barack Obama including the violation of Venezuelan airspace on January 8th 2010 by a P3 bomber and before that by a remote controlled 'drone', and particularly condemns the opening up of seven military bases in Colombia to the US military, a clear threat to Venezuela. This Hands Off Venezuela conference calls for all Latin American countries to follow the example set by Ecuador and close US military bases in their countries, and remove any US military presence from their own bases, as these only serve to strengthen US imperialism in Latin America. Resolution in solidarity with the workers of the occupied factories This HOV Conference shows its solidarity with the workers of the occupied factories in Venezuela. Their struggle is an inspiration for workers all over the world. We support the call for the nationalisation of INAF, Gotcha, Vivex and the other factories in struggle so that production can be put under workers control for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.  Resolution on the work with the Coordinadora Latinoamericana This Hands Off Venezuela conference recognises the importance of continued work within the Coordinadora Latinoamericana in promoting solidarity alongside other grassroots campaigns on important Latin American issues. Conference recognises that it is imperialism which force many immigrants to come to Europe and applauds the Coordinadora’s work in solidarity with Latinos in the UK. Hands Off Venezuela conference endorses the campaign for Latin-American Recognition and the struggles for increased migrant workers rights and against the racist immigration controls . This conference applauds the achievements of the Coordinator Latinomericana and calls for continued solidarity amongst the campaigns involved. Resolution on the call for a V International This Hands Off Venezuela conference notes that Hugo Chavez has made an appeal for the formation of a Fifth International. Faced with the capitalist crisis and the threat of war that is putting at risk the future of humanity, ""the people are clamoring for"" greater unity of THE left and revolutionary parties willing to fight for socialism, he said. Furthermore, the First Extraordinary Congress of the PSUV passed a resolution calling for the founding of a ""Fifth Socialist International as a space for socialist-oriented parties, movements and currents in which we can harmonize a common strategy for the struggle against imperialism, the overthrow of capitalism by socialism,"". This Hands Off Venezuela conference welcomes this initiative and recognises the benefits to solidarity work in defence of the Bolivarian revolution it can bring. It instructs the committee to initiate discussions among HOV supporters and in the wider labour and trade union movement with a view to supporting the formation of a V International and to participate in preparatory discussions towards this. Solidarity with Honduras This Hands Off Venezuela conference condemns the undemocratic coup against president Mel Zelaya in Honduras a year ago. We reject the government of Porfirio Lobo which came out of an election which the majority of the people of Honduras rejected as it took place with no democratic guarantees, and was organized and conducted by the coup plotters. We express our solidarity with the resistance movement of the people of Honduras and with the National Peoples’ Resistance Front (FNPR). We also express our outrage at the campaign of selective assassination of resistance activists carried out under the Lobo government. We call on the British government not to recognize the illegitimate government of Porfirio Lobo and to work for the restoration of democracy in Honduras. Conference instructs the HOV Steering Committee to give practical support to the international observers delegation to Honduras in June 2010.  Resolution on John McDonnell This Hands Off Venezuela conference congratulates John McDonnell for his tireless work in defence OF and in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela. Conference condemns the position taken by the previous New Labour Govermment against the Bolivarian revolution and recognizes that things are likely to get worse with the Conservative – Liberal government. Therefore Hands off Venezuela supports John McDonnell’s bid for Labour leader and urges Labour Party members to work to make sure he is on the ballot paper.

													Hands Off Venezuela","Eva Golinger, journalist, attorney and author of 'The Chavez Code', recently wrote an opinion piece in a popular daily newspaper in favour of Venezuelan relations with the genocidal government of Sri Lanka which has caused much shock and unease. As a strong defender of the Venezuelan revolution many people rightly respect Golinger's work, and for this reason we give space to some of the responses in a wish to open up debate. Contents: Original article by Eva Golinger titled 'Sri Lanka', english translation Response #1 - Eva Golinger's misinformation endangers exiled Tamils' fight for freedom by Latin American solidarity groups in Canada Response #2 - Eva Golinger Misinterprets Solidarity: Support Tamils not Sri Lanka’s War Criminal Government by Ron Ridenour Response #3 - Vheadline.com Editorial - Eva Golinger and the Tiger Tamils by Patrick J. O'Donoghue Sri Lanka by Eva Golinger, english translation 21/05/10.- Sri Lanka is located at the southern extreme of India in the Indian Ocean. The small country of 21 million habitants is found at the crux of all maritime routes in the region: 70% of global petroleum commerce and 50% of container shipments pass through the port of Sri Lanka. It possesses the deepest natural bay of Asia and abundant natural resources, such as tea, rubber, copper, iron, and other important minerals. It has the largest gas and oil fields in the South of Asia. In other words, Sri Lanka is a highly strategic country. So, it isn’t surprising that Washington desires to establish a military base in its territory and a centre of operations for NATO in the Indian Ocean. Soon after a great war that kept it in civil conflict, in 2005, Sri Lanka celebrated presidential elections for the first time in 30 years. Mahinda Rajapaksa obtained a sizeable victory with more than 58% of votes. He was reelected with more than 60% in January of 2010. Rajapaksa, a Buddhist leader, is supported by a coalition of parties of the left, amongst them the Communist Party. In May 2009, it was able to end the civil war, putting a stop to the armed organization the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The LTTE has strong ties with the CIA, and Washington negotiated an agreement with them to establish a military base in its country, were they able to get to power. Soon after their defeat, the LTTE established numerous organizations – fronts in different countries around the world, searching to create a “government in exile” and to be able to isolate the current Government of Sri Lanka. Last week, representatives of one such front, Canadian Hart, passed through Venezuela; he met with government functionaries looking for support in an attempt to weaken relations between the two governments. Instead of making connections with the illegitimate opposition of Sri Lanka, Venezuela should be strengthening the hand of an ally that is also suffering imperial aggressions. Taken from El Correo del Orinoco, Section: World Source: http://www.ciudadccs.org.ve/?p=67633 Eva Golinger's misinformation endangers exiled Tamils' fight for freedom by Latin American solidarity groups in Canada We, organizations in Canada that have been working for years in solidarity with the Bolivarian process and have been responding to misinformation against Venezuela and the revolution. We have also been strong admirers of Eva Golinger's standard of investigative journalism and advocacy against imperialism. Today we are compelled to address what appears to be some misinformation in her piece titled 'Sri Lanka', printed in the Correo del Orinoco on Saturday, May 15. Eva Golinger's article makes a number of claims, including that the Canadian Humanitarian Appeal for the Relief of Tamils (HART) is a front group for the now defunct Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This is a bold , not to mention dangerous and ultimately false assertion. As organizations on the ground here in Canada, we know this organization to be largely first generation youth of Tamil origin who have been working tirelessly to educate people on the situation of the 300,000 internally displaced Tamils in Sri Lanka as well as those in forced migration. The charge that Eva Golinger is labelling on them is the same that our own (Canadian) government ... the reactionary government of Stephen Harper ... has been looking to place on them for some time now. In Canada, where groups like the LTTE are categorized as terrorist -- just as they categorize Hamas in Gaza, the FARC in Colombia and many other groups globally -- carries what could be a lengthy jail sentence. It is disappointing to see such un-validated claims considering Eva Golinger's record of well-researched literature and articles. Unfortunately, the same claims appear in articles in Sri Lanka such as the article Sri Lanka's The Sunday Times entitled 'Tiger Carcass in Caracas' http://www.sundaytimes.lk/100516/News/nws_05.html and other media sources which re-iterate these false statement in an attempt to cast doubt on the work of these young activists. Much of this response, both from Eva Golinger's article, and those in Sri Lanka before it, appear to have been prompted by the recent article in Cuidad CCS entitled 'Piden refugio en Venezuela para desplazados tamiles.' http://www.ciudadccs.org.ve/?p=61361 This article is telling in a number of different ways. First of all, it reveals that Canadian HART is in fact engaging in advocacy around Tamil refugees particularly the case of the close to 300 Tamil refugees in Indonesia, as the article makes clear. Canadian HART has been a participant organization in Frente Norman Bethune... an internationalist solidarity project which looks to establish people to people solidarity between movements and organizations in Canada and those in Venezuela. *We believe Venezuela represents a hope in our world, a place where the principles of social justice, equality and popular democracy are being struggled for by the people. These are universals which should be available to all people, and the struggle of any people denied these basics are the struggle of all.* Secondly, the deplorable situation of the majority of Tamils in Sri Lanka and the sheer number of civilians killed should give one cause to reconsider the label that Eva Golinger has placed on Sri Lanka. In characterizing the government of Sri Lanka as 'leftist' and a victim of 'imperialism,' she has, unfortunately, overlooked the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and the 7,000-20,000 Tamil civilians killed in the military offensive of 2009 using Israeli weaponry such as AI Kfir fighter jets and Super Dvora Mk III class patrol vessels. There was no mention of Rajapaska's statements to TIME Magazine that Sri Lanka ""followed what [George W.] Bush said. We accomplished what he wanted: eliminate terrorism. They must give credit to us. We fought their war."" Nor is there any consideration for the comments of Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States, Jaliya Wickramasuriya, when he met with Bush to share his appreciation of US support to Sri Lanka in its continuing struggle to combat terrorism, especially the pro-active measures taken by the US toward this end."" There are may other facts which dispel the characterization of the Rajapaksa government and state as 'progressive' or 'anti-imperialist.' We are not LTTE supporters, as it is not our place to tell people who their representatives or spokespeople should be. We are also not telling sovereign governments like Venezuela who they should trade and establish relationships with. However we are committed to an anti-imperialism that is internationalist, and as such strongly ask Eva Golinger to reconsider her positions and particularly her claims labelled against committed, revolutionary activists whose well-being -- and even lives -- are threatened by such baseless allegations.

She is a noted author (“The Chavez Code: Cracking US intervention in Venezuela”). A dual citizen of the US and Venezuela, she is an attorney, and a personal friend of President Hugo Chavez, who dubbed her, “La Novía de Venezuela”. (Novía means “bride”.) She is a frequent contributor to left-wing media around the world, and is the English editor of the Venezuela government newspaper, “Correo del Orinoco”. Golinger is a name synonymous with solidarity and anti-imperialism. However, she recently inexplicably immersed herself into being a supporter for the most brutal, racist and genocidal government of Sri Lanka in a resoundingly irresponsible opinion piece printed in the Spanish daily version of “ Correo del Orinoco ”, May 15, and on May 21, published by the Caracas city government newspaper, “ Ciudad CCS ”. The piece was simply entitled, “Sri Lanka”. Printed in Spanish, I translate into English the major part of its content and analyze its errors with the goal of countering rumors she started, and in an effort to broaden support for a most maligned and oppressed ethnic group, the Tamils of Sri Lanka. Golinger wrote that, in 2005, Sri Lanka “presidential elections occurred for the first time in nearly 30 years. Mahinda Rajapakse obtained victory with more than 58% of votes. He was reelected, January 2010 with more than 60%.” “Rajapakse, Buddhist leader, is supported by a coalition of leftist parties, among them the Communist Party. In May, 2009, Rajapaske finalized the civil war, defeating the armed organization, LTTE. “The LTTE had close ties with the CIA, and Washington negotiated an accord with them for establishing a military base in the country, if they obtained power. Upon its defeat, the LTTE had established numerous organizations—fronts in different countries around the world, seeking to create `a government in exile´ and hoping to isolate the current government of Sri Lanka. Last week, representatives of one of its fronts, Canadian Hart, passed through Venezuela; it met with government functionaries seeking support in its intent to weaken the relationship between the two governments. “Instead of relating to the illegitimate opposition in Sri Lanka, Venezuela should shake the hand of an ally that also suffers imperial aggressions.” Golinger is factually incorrect US Supports Sri Lanka Genocide The Indian Ocean is a vital waterway where half the world’s containerized cargo passes through. Its waters carry heavy traffic of petroleum products. Sri Lanka cooperation is vital to the US Empire’s global interests. A separated Tamil state would complicate cooperation requirements. The United States of America has been arming and financing Sri Lanka for most of the civil war period. [ www.cdi.org/PDFs/CSBillCharts.pdf ] From at least the 1990s, the US has provided military training, financing, logistic supplies and weapons sales worth millions annually. A Voice of America installation was set up in the northwestern part of the country. The United States government praised Rajapaksa for restarting the war already in July 2006, and officially ending the ceasefire in 2008. The US embassy in Colombo issued this statement: “The United States does not advocate that the Government of Sri Lanka negotiate with the LTTE…” http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=11769 On May 26, 2002, the Colombo English-language Sunday Times wrote about a joint military pact between Sri Lanka and the U.S., a development taken soon after the CSA was signed. http://sundaytimes.lk/020526/index.html “The Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement [ACSA]…will enable the United States to utilise Sri Lanka's ports, airports and air space. As a prelude to the signing of the agreement scheduled for July, this year, United States Naval ships have been calling at the Colombo Port for bunkering as well as to enable sailors to go on shore leave. “In return for the facilities offered, Sri Lanka is to receive military assistance from the United States including increased training facilities and equipment. The training, which will encompass joint exercises with United States Armed Forces, will focus on counter terrorism and related activity. The agreement will be worked out on the basis of the use of Sri Lanka's ports, airports, and air space to be considered hire-charges that will be converted for military hardware.” US Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca was the key liaison person with the Sri Lankan government. [Rocca had been a CIA officer before joining the state department.] www.sundaytimes.lk/020526/front/defence.htm . The ACSA agreement was not finally signed until Rajapaksa came to power. It was U.S. citizen Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Secretary Defense Minister, and brother to President Rajapaksa, who signed the agreement, on March 5, 2007. (Their younger brother, also a minister, is a US citizen as well.) George W. Bush was especially glad for Sri Lanka’s state terrorism. In 2006, he encouraged the government to resume the civil war, which Bush financed with $2.9 million. The Pentagon provided counter-insurgency training, maritime radar, patrols of US warships and aircraft. This was a continuation of “Operation Balanced Style”, which uses U.S. Special Forces instructors since 1996. At the end of Bush’s first term, the US was forced to cut back on aid given that it was bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq. That, coupled with critical public opinion, organized by the Diaspora, of state terrorism and systematic discrimination of Tamils, prompted congress to make noises about abuses of human rights by not only LTTE but possibly by paramilitary forces linked to the S.L. government. Thousands of Tamils blocked highways in Canada, camped outside British parliament for months, some committed suicide in front of government offices, while Indian Tamils conducted paralyzing strikes. Nevertheless, in 2008, the U.S. granted $1.45 million in military financing and training to the Sri Lanka government out of a total of $7.4 million in total aid. The US made noises about a ‘humanitarian crisis’ when the Sri Lankan army was about to finish the war but it never took affirmative action to bring the war to an end nor to condemn the army or government. Even after leading international observers, and some of the mass media, especially in the U.K. and France, began to expose S.L. government and the army’s systematic atrocities against Tamil civilians, and captured LTTE soldiers, the US continued to back up the Sri Lankan government, in contradiction to Eva Golinger. In mid-April, 2010, the U.S. and Sri Lankan military forces conducted military exercises in Eastern Seas (Trincomalee) for the first time in 25 years. Said Lt Col Larry Smith, the US defense attache: “The joint exercise helped members from our two militaries to exchange best practices on how to address complex humanitarian challenges.” He added: “The US and Sri Lanka have a long tradition of cooperation. We hope this partnership can be expanded.” http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/04/us-sri-lankan-militaries-in-joint.html Documentary film-maker John Pilger compares Sri Lanka’s genocide to Israel “The Sri Lankan government has learned an old lesson from, I suspect, a modern master: Israel. In order to conduct a slaughter, you ensure the pornography is unseen, illicit at best. You ban foreigners and their cameras from Tamil towns like Mulliavaikal, which was bombarded recently by the Sri Lankan army, and you lie that the 75 people killed in the hospital were blown up quite willfully by a Tamil suicide bomber. ” “Distant Voices, Desperate Lives,” New Statesman, 13-5-09. When the U.S. does not want to be seen on the frontlines in a war, it sends in surrogates and Israel is its main partner in this war crime. Israel was officially re-awarded diplomatic relations, in May 2000, after Sri Lanka had severed them in 1970, in protest at Israel’s continued illegal expansion into Palestinian territory. Nevertheless, Israel continued to operate inside S.L. out of a special interests office set up in the US embassy. Under the table, Sri Lanka’s successive regimes embraced Israel’s military advisors, a special commando unit in the police, and Mossad counter-intelligence agents—who sought to drive a wedge between Muslims and Tamils. Israel sent Sri Lanka16 of its supersonic Kfir fighter jets, some Dvora fast naval attack craft, and electronic and imagery surveillance equipment, plus advisors and technicians. Israel personnel took part in military attacks on Tamil units, and its pilots flew attack aircraft. Tigers shot down one Kfir. Just before the end of the war, Prime Minister Wickremanayake was in Israel to make bigger deals with Israeli arms supplies. [ www.dailymailnews.com/dmsp0204/dm44.html http://niqnaq.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/wayne-madsen-on-israel-and-sri-lanka/ http://adamite.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/sri-lanka-israels-dirty-secrets/ ] Sri Lanka government war crimes G olinger even ignores ample evidence of extreme war crimes committed by her choice for president, Mahinda Rajapakse, against the minority Tamils. They have a righteous claim for liberation because of being subject to systematic discrimination, oppression and genocide. (Ibid: “Equal Rights or Self-Determination”.) Sri Lanka’s first president, J.R.Jayewardene, expressed the essence of this genocide to the “Daily Telegraph”, on July 11, 1983. “Really if I starve the Tamils out, the Sinhala people will be happy.” In May 2009, Rajapakse had all the civilians who survived his gun fire placed into concentration camps, which he called “welfare villages”, much like those the Yankees concocted in Vietnam. In violation of United Nations international rules, as many as from 280,000 to one-half million people were forced interned. Today, one year later, 100,000 remain. Only two million S.L. Tamils remain in the country. Nearly one million have fled in the past three decades. Even the U.S.’s choice for secretary-general of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, was displeased with these camps when he made a brief visit to one shortly after the war’s end. “I have traveled around the world and visited similar places, but this is by far the most appalling scenes I have seen…I sympathize fully with all of the displaced persons.” Several internationally respected organizations concerned about war crimes, and a few mass media journalists, have conducted interviews with IDPs, taken or viewed photographs, videos, satellite images—taken surreptitiously during the war—and have read electronic communications and documents from many sources. Some observers have been able to visit a camp or two. On May 17, one of those organizations, the International Crisis Group, released its report, “War Crimes in Sri Lanka”. I cite from it: “The Sri Lanka security forces and the LTTE repeatedly violated international humanitarian law during the last five months of their 30-year civil war…from January 2009 to the government’s declaration of victory in May [violations worsened]. Evidence gathered by the International Crisis Group suggests that these months saw tens of thousands of Tamil civilian men, women, children and elderly killed, countless more wounded, and hundreds of thousands deprived of adequate food and medical care, resulting in more deaths. “This evidence also provides reasonable grounds to believe the Sri Lanka security forces committed war crimes with top government and military leaders potentially responsible.” Here is a revealing example of this evidence. On August 25, 2009, Channel 4 News (UK) broadcast raw footage, one minute long, showing S.L. government soldiers casually executing eight bound and blindfolded, naked Tamil men, believed to be LTTE combatants. This is a war crime according to all international agreements. Rajapaska’s government denied the authenticity of the photos, apparently taken by a S.L. soldier and provided to Channel 4 through the exiled group of Sinhalese and Tamil journalists, Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka. But internationally renowned forensic experts have validated its authenticity. http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2009/12/sri-lankan-execution-video-not-fake.html http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/01/experts-strongly-suggest-that-video-is.html http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/sri+lanka+option/3652687 In a recent Channel 4 News broadcast by Jonathan Miller, two eyewitnesses spoke of systematic murder of all LTTE fighters caught or surrendered. One witness is a senior army commander: “Definitely, the order would have been to kill everybody and finish them off.” A frontline S.L. soldier told Miller: “Yes, our commander ordered us to kill everyone. We killed everyone.” Even the head general in charge of defeating the LTTE, General Fonseka, spoke of having orders from the Defense Secretary to kill leaders without taking prisoners—“all LTTE leaders must be killed”. http://www.defenceforum.in/forum/showthread.php/7399-Lanka-Army-killed-surrendering-LTTE-militants-Ex-General Returning to the International Crisis Group war crimes report: “Starting in late January [2009], the government and security forces encouraged hundreds of thousands of civilians to move into ever smaller government-declared No Fire Zones (NFZs) and then subjected them to repeated and increasingly intense artillery and mortar barrages and other fire. This continued through May despite the government and security forces knowing the size and location of the civilian population and scale of civilian casualties. “The security forces shelled hospitals and makeshift medical centres—many overflowing with the wounded and sick—on multiple occasions even though they knew of their precise locations and functions. During these incidents, medical staff, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and others continually informed the government and security forces of the shelling, yet they continued to strike medical facilities through May…” Among the charges that must be investigated, wrote ICG, is “the recruitment of children by the LTTE and the execution by the security forces of those who had laid down their arms and were trying to surrender.” Shortly after this report, Amnesty International released its report of torture in 111 countries. Among those A.I. condemns for the “politicization of justice” is Sri Lanka’s government. It also criticizes the UN “for its failure to intervene…By the end of the year, despite further evidence of war crimes and other abuses, no-one had been brought to justice,” A:I:’s Secretary General Claudio Cordone said. “One would be hard pressed to imagine a more complete failure to hold to account those who abuse human rights.” http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/05/amnestys-report-condemns-politicisation.html http://thereport.amnesty.org/regions/asia-pacific ; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9vb-ORJCgg Some leaders of ALBA countries may be under the impression that when westerners (A.I., ICG, Channel 4) protest about human rights abuse that this reflects the double speak language of white imperialism, or NGO imperialists. This is sometimes the case. But it is definitely not so with Sri Lanka. None of the western governments on the HRC wished to condemn Sri Lanka. They only condemned the LTTE and simply asked Sri Lanka to look into its own behavior during the war. Do not take my word or those of A.I and ICG for this assessment alone but look at the conclusions drawn by internationally renowned figures with impeccable solidarity credentials, such as Francois Houtart, who, among other positions, is an honorary professor at the University of Havana. He chaired an 11-judge panel looking into war crimes charges against Sri Lanka’s government and army—the Permanent People’s Tribunal on Sri Lanka (PPT), held in Dublin in January. Among the many supporters of the panel and their conclusions is the senior advisor to President Daniel Ortega, Miguel D´Escoto. Ironically, Nicaragua is one of the ALBA countries that praised the Sri Lanka government and voted for their resolution at the HRC. The PPT’s conclusions approximate those allegations made by the above mentioned organizations: Sri Lanka committed “war crimes” and “crimes against humanity”. These conclusions are found on pages 14-15 of the 50-page verdict. 5. On the Qualifications of the Facts “Summing up the facts established before this Tribunal by reports from NGOs, victims’ testimony, eye-witnesses accounts, expert testimony and journalistic reports, we are able to distinguish three different kinds of human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan Government from 2002 (the beginning of the CFA) to the present: • Forced “disappearances” of targeted individuals from the Tamil population; • Crimes committed in the re-starting of the war (2006-2009), particularly during the last months of the war: • Bombing civilian objectives like hospitals, schools and other non-military targets; • Bombing government-proclaimed ‘safety zones’ or ‘no fire zones’; • Withholding of food, water, and health facilities in war zones; • Use of heavy weaponry, banned weapons and air-raids; • Using food and medicine as a weapon of war; • The mistreatment, torture and execution of captured or surrendered LTTE combatants, officials and supporters; • Torture; • Rape and sexual violence against women; • Deportations and forcible transfer of individuals and families; • Desecrating the dead; • Human rights violations in the IDP camps during and after the end of the war: • Shooting of Tamil citizens and LTTE supporters; • Forced disappearances; • Rape; • Malnutrition; and • Lack of medical supplies” http://transcurrents.com/tc/2010/01/full_text_verdict_of_the_perma.html http://www.pptsrilanka.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=109&catid=30&Itemid=36 Conclusion I urge ALBA members of the Human Rights Council—Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua—along with their brothers and sisters in Venezuela to recognize an error made when they promulgated Sri Lanka’s own resolution laid before the HRC and adopted by the majority, on May 27, 2009--Resolution S-11/1, “assistance to Sri Lanka in the promotion and protection of human rights” http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9105&LangID=E . The self-serving resolution only condemned the LTTE for acts of terror while praising the Sri Lankan government and supporting, naturally, its right to sovereignty. These ALBA countries, along with most members of the Non-Aligned Movement on the Council, let the entire Tamil people down, especially the Internally Displaced Persons. My assessment is shared by the people’s tribunal in paragraph 5.5: “The Tribunal stresses the responsibility of the Member States of the United Nations that have not complied with their moral obligation to seek justice for the violations of human rights committed during the last period of war. After repeated pleas, and in spite of the appalling conditions experienced by Tamils, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Security Council failed to establish an independent commission of inquiry to investigate those responsible for the atrocities committed due to political pressure exerted by certain Members.” The PPT came to the opposite conclusion that Golinger does on all accounts. The US is not an actor of “aggression” against Sri Lanka’s government rather it is the case of one war criminal supporting another. The tribunal “highlights the conduct of the European Union in undermining the CFA of 2002. In spite of being aware of the detrimental consequences to a peace process in the making, the EU decided - under pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom - to list the TRM (Tamil Resistance Movement, which included the LTTE) as a terrorist organization in 2006. This decision allowed the Sri Lankan Government to breach the ceasefire agreement and re-start military operations leading to the massive violations listed above. It also points to the full responsibility of those governments, led by the United States, that are conducting the so-called “Global War on Terror” (GWOT) in providing political endorsement of the conduct of the Sri Lankan Government and armed forces in a war that is primarily targeted against the Tamil people.” As solidarity activists, we advocate the right to resist and the necessity to conduct armed struggle once peaceful means fail to induce oppressive governments to engage in a process aimed at justice and equality—such is the case in Sri Lanka with the Tamil people, just as surely as it is in Palestine. I find that most armed movements commit acts of atrocities, even acts of terror. The struggle for liberation in Cuba was an exception to the rule. Fortunately, it lasted just over two years. The armed struggle for liberation from Sinhala oppression against another indigenous group lasted for quarter of a century and, at the end, the LTTE clearly did resort to acts of desperation and terror. Other brave and righteous groups fighting for liberation, for equality and justice, such as Colombia’s FARC and Palestine’s PFLP, have also committed acts of terror. The ANC in South Africa was brutal in its struggle for liberation. I wonder how I would act in such circumstances! True solidarity activists have no choice. We must support the Tamil people. Today, they are in disarray. Various tendencies are in formation. But dialogue with them all is what solidarity forces must engage in around the world. One tendency is the new Provisional Transitional Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE), which just formerly constituted itself in Philadelphia. Their coordinator, Visuvanathan Rudrakumaran, is a resident of the United States and an attorney. In February, he filed a suit in the US Supreme Court that would negate parts of the U.S. Patriotic Act and allow people to provide “material support or resources” to armed groups fighting for their liberation. Tamil Eelam advocates in the US have associated with the civil rights organization, Humanitarian Law Project, and along with supporters of the crushed LTTE and the PKK (Kurdish rebels in Turkey) are seeking to legitimize the rights of oppressed minorities to fight for liberation, if necessary with arms when peaceful means are impossible. See TGTE’s website: http://govtamileelam.org/gov/ My main motivation for siding with people who fight against oppression and for liberation is a matter of basic solidarity morality, and an understanding of this necessity for the suffering people. The basic reason why so many millions of people have respected and loved Che Guevara is because of this moral stance. To back any corrupt, capitalist, genocidal government—albeit in the name of support for “sovereignty”—is not consistent with Che’s and our collective moral stance. June 1, 2010 Source: RonRidenour.com EDITORIAL: Eva Golinger and the Tiger Tamils VHeadline News Editor Patrick J. O'Donoghue writes: I couldn't believe what I read in the Caracas CC blatt! According to Eva Golinger, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka have close links with the CIA and therefore, the Venezuelan government should ignore them and rather connect to the legitimate opposition in Sri Lanka. Eva Golinger is editor-in-chief of the government's mouthpiece, 'El Correo del Orinoco' (in English) and therefore her opinion on foreign affairs carries weight, especially since she has made US state documents available to the general public with salient and penetrating commentaries. I just hope that Chavez doesn't take her word for it on the Tamils and is properly briefed by Foreign Minister for Asia, Temir Porras before entering the minefield of Sri Lanka politics. On Thursday, VHeadline.com broke the story originating in the Tamil ""The Daily Mirror,"" which did not mention the (Tamil) Canadian Hart group that visited Caracas to take up contact with the Foreign Ministry seeking recognition of a Tamil organization in exile. Golinger's charges are that Washington negotiated with the Tigers for a US military base in a future independent Tamil Republic. The USA, it appeared, also drew up an agreement with the Sri Lanka government for military relations and had formally declared the Tamil Tigers a terrorist organization, despite the fact that -- like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- the Tigers have been combating the Sri Lanka state dominated by the Sinhalese for decades. I have talked briefly to several experts in London, who are disgruntled with the contents of Ms. Golinger's article in Caracas CC. There is no mention of human rights abuses against Tamil villages and communities in the north of the island committed by the victorious Sri Lanka military and continuing in the post-war concentration camps. The Tamils in London are a regular feature in front of the Houses of Parliament protesting the British government's failure to raise its voice about what they call genocide during the final offensive and repression after the war. It is not the first time that President Chavez has been caught out internationally. and it is hoped that his government will study the case of Sri Lanka with care before making any rash statement. The Tamils Tigers are re-grouping and setting up representations abroad ... first of all where there are large Tamil ex-pat communities, such as London, the USA and Canada ... and where they believe and expect to find a sympathetic hearing, such as in Cuba and Venezuela. The Sri Lankan government has an envoy in Havana, who rushed to Caracas to stop the visiting Tamils from getting a hearing. Ms. Golinger's blanket suggestion that Venezuela should pay no attention to overtures from the Tamil Tiger front organizations and instead ""shake the hand of an ally that has also suffered imperial aggressions"" beggars belief. Unless, of course, I and others are mistaken on this one and she knows something that we don't. Patrick J. O'Donoghue This email address is being protected from spambots.

			Toronto: HOV delegation report-backs from Venezuelan Revolution",2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela (Canada)","On 8th May, about 40 people filled the OPSEU union hall in downtown Toronto to listen to a report-back by Fightback editorial board member Camilo Cahis, and Toronto Young New Democrats (TYND) Co-Chair Jennie Ernewein. Both Camilo and Jennie were part of a Hands Off Venezuela/Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel” delegation to Venezuela. Although the delegation was originally intended to participate in the founding conference of the V International (which has now been postponed until after the September parliamentary elections), the two comrades were able to visit worker-controlled factories, participate in the bi-centennial independence celebrations, talk to ordinary workers and PSUV members, and were invited to attend the congress of the Marxists within the PSUV. Both Camilo and Jennie reported on their trips to two different worker controlled factories, INAF and INVEVAL. Jennie said, “This is what workers’ power is all about; people taking their lives away from the rich and into their own hands.” She talked about many of the advances that the delegation saw happening within the factories. One worker at INVEVAL, for instance, had worked there for over 30 years but up until a couple of years ago, had never been able to read or write. Thanks to Mision Robinson, he had learned to write and was now doing post-secondary studies thanks to Mision Ribas, all while still working at INVEVAL. Camilo spoke about the revolution’s need to make a clear break with capitalism. The workers of the occupied factories in Venezuela realize the important advances that they have made, but also realize the limitations if these factories are not part of a national plan of production. “The workers know that taking individual factories away from the bosses isn’t enough. Both of the factories that we visited are struggling at the moment because they cannot find enough raw materials to ramp up production. What is needed is to reproduce this kind of workers’ control over the whole of society. The first step towards that is the expropriation of the oligarchy, which still, unfortunately, controls the bulk of the economy.” The speakers described the situation is Venezuela as a polarized situation between the ruling-class on one side, and the workers and poor on the other. “The rich, despite what you might hear in the corporate media, haven’t lost anything. We saw the wealthy East side of Caracas. It puts Forest Hill and Rosedale [two very wealthy neighbourhoods in Toronto] to shame,” Camilo said. “They are used to having a great deal of power in the economy, and they are using it to sabotage the revolution in anyway they can.” The two described how the oligarchs create artificial shortages of vital goods, especially food. One family (the owners of Polar) controls 60% of food production and distribution in Venezuela and are capable of manipulating scarcity throughout the country in order to destabilize the government. The media (which is still largely in private hands) creates artificial scares of food shortages in order to cause hoarding and rushes on supermarkets and stores. While the comrades were there, the media had played up fears that there were shortages of bread flour; the previous week, it had been toilet paper. The comrades also described how the crisis of capitalism and the growing polarization are creating waves in the new PSUV (United Socialist Party of Venezuela). 2.5-million Venezuelans registered to vote in internal party elections, which are occurring as part of the on-going formation of the relatively new political party. “Can you imagine getting that number of people involved in any political party in this country? It’s the height of hypocrisy that the corporate media can call Venezuela a ‘dictatorship’ even while the press here gives Stephen Harper a free-pass to shut down parliament,” Camilo said. The PSUV has become the focal point for Venezuela revolutionaries, and the battle against right-wing careerists and bureaucratic elements has heated up. “They need a party that fights for socialism now,” Jennie said, “and that is what the workers and the poor genuinely want to build.” The bi-centennial celebrations also took place while the delegation was in Venezuela. Half a million revolutionaries filled the street of Caracas to celebrate their country’s independence and their revolution. Camilo stated how the parade’s military display was particularly impressive and how it signified that this was an armed revolution, where the workers would not be afraid of defending their revolutionary movement. “There is an opening up of another period of mobilization amongst the workers and poor, and you could clearly see that at the celebrations,” Camilo said. “The height of the day was at the end of the military parade, the soldiers got out of their tanks and embraced the crowd. Workers climbed up on the military vehicles. You got the sense that the army and the people are one. This must worry the imperialists as it removes their time-honoured dependence on the military as a bulwark for reaction and coups.” The United States government has recently taken over many military bases in Colombia and in the Caribbean, surrounding Venezuela militarily. The threat of an invasion of Venezuela by US imperialism is real. But the mobilization of the people is a warning to Washington and their proxies both in Colombian and in Venezuela. “President Chávez has said that the best way to defend the revolution is to spread it,” Jennie said, closing her speech, “We have to organize, as socialists, both to spread the message of the Venezuelan revolution here and to learn its lessons and apply them in our struggles in this country.” “The Venezuelan workers want to eradicate capitalism, and are fighting hard to do so,” Camilo summarized, “They are forging their forces in the PSUV, through factory occupations, and through the demand for the expropriation of the economy, once and for all, from the hands of the elite.”",NA,NA

			Canada: Launch of Latin American Peace Initiative - Stop war and defend social gains in Latin America!",2010-03-30T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela (Canada)","Hands Off Venezuela, the Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel,” Latin@s, the Latin American Solidarity Network, and the Venezuelan embassy and Consulate-General in Toronto gathered for the launch meeting of the Latin American Peace Initiative (LAPI), which seeks to prevent a new war in Latin America. The conference, held at the OPSEU Hall in downtown Toronto, was chaired by Alex Grant and Maria Paez Victor, both representing HOV and the Bolivarian Circle. The need to build an anti-war campaign for Latin America has gained a new impetus given last summer’s coup in Honduras and recent attacks on Venezuela by Canada’s Peter Kent and the US’ Hillary Clinton. The Reuters article at the end of this report reveal the imperialists’ interests regarding Venezuela. The first featured speaker was Peggy Nash, president of the federal NDP and the NDP’s candidate in Parkdale-High Park in the next federal election. Peggy spoke about her experiences in building solidarity with Latin American movements and her personal experiences of travelling to Chile prior to the coup d’état in 1973. Peggy admitted that she, like many other Canadians, did not realize how much imperialist aggression had escalated in South America and the very real dangers that Venezuela was facing. She emphasized how the federal NDP has been leading the campaign against the Canada-Colombia free trade agreement that is currently being debated in Parliament. She promised to push Latin American solidarity within the NDP and make sure that it is highlighted by the party. Nchamah Miller, spokesperson for Latin@s Canada , spoke next with details about the increasing US militarization of South America. The mobilization by US imperialism is its response, under the Monroe Doctrine, to try to preserve US interests in Latin America. Nchamah outlined how the United States has reacted to the perceived “threat” to their interests. The US has activated their Fourth Fleet in the Caribbean and activated a new base in Panama so that they can have access to this fleet. More dangerously, the US has taken control of 16 military bases in Colombia (mostly near the border with Venezuela), as well as activating at least 71 bases throughout the southern cone of Latin America. Latin American countries are banding together to fight the US threat by proposing a new Organization of American States, which will not include either the US or Canada. The last speaker was José Antonio Rodríguez de la Sierra, attaché to the Venezuelan Embassy in Ottawa. José Antonio gave an admirable presentation that was prepared by the original invited speaker, Captain Juan Carlos Coronado, the charge d’affairs at the Venezuelan Embassy, who unfortunately was unable to attend due to health reasons. Speaking from the prepared notes, José Antonio reiterated the dangers facing Venezuela in the current period. He also mentioned that since the revolution began in Venezuela, Venezuela had never threatened war on anyone, unlike the actions and propaganda of the United States. To summarize the discussion, Alex Grant from HOV thanked the Consulate, the Embassy, the sponsoring organizations, and all those present. Alex explained that this was our opportunity to build a new anti-war movement based on Latin America. The past movements against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq had a problem that on the opposing side were the Taliban and Saddam Hussein; nobody would get enthusiastic about defending these reactionary regimes. However, in Latin America, we’re defending the revolutionary movements of the people in Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Cuba. We’re defending the right of the people of the region to use their resources to raise their own standards of living, instead of going to Western corporations. This means that the movement to stop war in Latin America can be built with great enthusiasm. A little over 75 people attended the conference. After the speakers, attendees mingled with the speakers and organizers, and enjoyed refreshments kindly provided by the Venezuelan Consulate in Toronto. Nearly $200 was also collected to help HOV send observers to the upcoming launch of the Fifth International in Caracas. Everyone left the meeting committed to informing their friends and co-workers about the growing threat of war in Latin America and the need to build an active movement that doesn’t just aim to stop war, but to defend the gains of the revolutions in Latin America. By Anthony Boadle WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief of the U.S. military's Southern Command said on Thursday that Venezuela's socialist government is a ""destabilizing force"" in Latin America and continues to back leftist guerrillas in Colombia. General Douglas Fraser's comments in congressional testimony came a week after he told a U.S. Senate hearing that the Pentagon had no evidence of a ""government-to-terrorist"" connection between President Hugo Chavez's government and Colombian FARC rebels. Southern Command is responsible for U.S. military activities in much of Latin America. Fraser, testifying to the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said Venezuela remains a threat to U.S. interests. ""They continue to have a very anti-U.S. stance and look to try and restrict U.S. activity wherever they have the opportunity to do that,"" Fraser said. ""They are continuing to engage with the region ... and continuing to pursue their socialism agenda. ... They remain a destabilizing force in the region,"" the general said. Fraser said Venezuela continues to provide the FARC a safe haven and ""financial logistical support"" based on information found on a laptop computer of a FARC commander seized by Colombian soldiers during a raid on a guerrilla camp in Ecuador in 2008. 'AGGRESSIVE POLICY' Venezuela's ambassador in Washington, Bernardo Alvarez, said the reversal of the general's position, to conform with statements by officials in the Obama administration, showed the United States has no proof of Venezuelan support for the FARC and the criticism was politically motivated. During a recent tour of Latin America, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stepped up criticism of Chavez, a populist leader who is the fiercest opponent of U.S. influence in the region even though his country is a major supplier of oil to the United States. Alvarez said the data on the computer cited by Fraser had been ""manipulated"" to cook up accusations against Venezuela that are aimed at justifying the deployment of U.S. troops to bases in Colombia, the main U.S. security ally in the region. ""The Obama administration is continuing the aggressive policy against Venezuela of the Bush administration,"" Alvarez said in an interview. ""They cannot accept a government with a different ideological perspective in this hemisphere,"" he said. Venezuela is among the five main oil suppliers to the United States and is its second-leading trading partner in Latin America after Mexico. Alvarez said the ideological hostility between the two governments has not affected Venezuelan oil supplies to the United States. ""Venezuela has no interest in reducing the oil trade,"" he said.",NA,NA

			Report back from HOV/SBQ, HOV/CBLR Parliamentary Presentation",2010-05-06T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HoV Canada","On Tuesday May 4th, representatives from HOV/SBQ in Montreal and HOV/CBLR in Toronto travelled to Parliament Hill in Ottawa to present on the human rights situation in Venezuela. Stéphanie Vaudry from HOV/SBQ presented very comprehensivley in French about the Misiones and the achievements of the Bolivarian government. Maria Paez Victor addressed the issue of human rights, the judiciary and the media. While we were presenting it appeared that the Liberal and Conservative MPs were preoccupied, chatting with aides, fiddling with Blackberries, etc. Wayne Marston from the NDP called them out on it when he spoke. Our fears that they were not listening and had already decided their position was confirmed when Liberal MP Mario Silva called us a ""Chavez fan club."" In response we called them out on their hypocrisy for not investigating the real human rights abuses in Colombia and Honduras. The Bloc Quebecois and NDP MPs were much more open minded. The representative from the Bloc asked about the reforms and also why Venezuela was such a contentious issue. Maria replied that the key issue was oil, ""if Venezuela produced potatoes and carrots, nobody would care."" Wayne Marston spoke about how he saw real fear of possible future coups and interventions and asked about the role of the Venezuelan military. Camilo Cahis reported on his recent trip to Venezuela where he saw how close the military was to the people and how this is an important defence against future military coups. Russ Hiebert spoke for the Conservatives. In a question clearly forwarded from oppositionists he asked whether we have staff and where our money comes from. This elicited a few laughs from our volunteer activists. Stéphanie explained that we receive no government funding and rely on passing the hat at our meetings. Hiebert pressed us on whether we admit that there are any human rights abuses in Venezuela. Alex Grant responded that of course there are problems, no country is without human rights problems, including Canada. Stéphanie then explained the harassment dealt out by CSIS to activists in Montreal. The full text that formed the basis of Stéphanie and Maria's presentations can be read here (pdf, French) and here (doc, English) and we have included a summary below. You can also listen to the entire hearing here: http://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/Parlvu/ContentEntityDetailView.aspx?ContentEntityId=6111 We strongly encourage other community organizations (Canadian and international), unions who have sent delegations to Venezuela, and individuals to send written reports in to the committee: Subcommittee on International Human Rights (SDIR) The report is set to be finished in September, just in time for the Venezuelan Parliamentary elections. There is a possibility that the Liberals and Conservatives are will use this as an opportunity to attack the Bolivarian revolution and if there is a wide response to this we will be able to turn this provocation around. It is ironic that they conducted this hearing into Venezuela on the exact day that the Liberals and Conservatives have moved to shut down discussion on Colombia free trade. 4 May 2010 The human rights situation in Venezuela is complicated by the recognized bias and distortion in media reportage, as shown by the successful Ontario Press Council complaint against the Toronto Star. Previous Venezuelan governments violated human rights with impunity. Most notable was the Caracazo massacre of February 1989 where approximately 3000 people were killed. In electing the Chávez government and reforming the constitution, human rights were put at the centre of the political and legal system. The private media in Venezuela no longer even considers itself objective. It is openly partisan and played a lead role not just supporting but organizing the coup of April 2002. However, the overwhelming majority of the media is still in private hands. But there has been a flowering of community media and freedom of expression. Venezuela has a body similar to Canada’s CRTC which has acted against media organizations that violate the media law which is similar to Canada’s. Venezuela has a longstanding problem with corruption that pre-dates the Chávez government. The government has taken real efforts to drive out this corruption, which has unfortunately been characterized by the opposition as political harassment. In previous governments, the police force was a repressive agency. It has now been modernized and reformed. For the first time in 40 years, there is no secret police in the country. Police are trained in crime prevention and human rights protection. They are forbidden to have live ammunition during demonstrations and or strikes. Venezuela faces a real terrorist threat from Colombian paramilitaries and the government has taken justified defensive measures. The Inter American Press Association and Human Rights Watch have criticized the Venezuelan government. Both their analyses have been proven to show bias by international experts on Latin America and it is noticeable that both failed to denounce the 2002 coup against the elected government of Venezuela. Venezuela is not a dictatorship. In the last 11 years, the Bolivarian movement has won 14 electoral contests and lost one, which they recognized. All have been considered fair and transparent by hundreds of international observers, including the Carter Centre. When compared with the past and with other government in the region, Venezuela has a very positive Human Rights record. We respectfully submit that to gain a full appreciation of the human rights situation in the region, that this committee also study the human rights record of Colombia and Honduras.",NA,NA

													HOV Denmark","More than 100 protestors on Tuesday took part in a picket in Copenhagen to commemorate the defeat of the CIA-backed coup in Venezuela on the 13 April eight years ago. The event was also a protest against the continued aggressions and coups on part of Imperialism in Latin America. The initiative to the manifestation was taken by the Danish branch of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The picket was arranged in cooperation with other solidarity and left wing organisations (see list in the bottom of the article). Frederik Ohsten, HOV activist and editor of the Marxist journal Socialistisk Standpunkt, welcomed the participants: “In the last period we have witnessed a revolutionary process in Latin America. This has meant progress for ordinary people. But in the last year, we have seen that the revolution is under threat. One of the main events marking a new offensive of Imperialism was the military coup in Honduras last summer,” he said. He explained that the US has used the eathquake catastrophe in Haiti to occupy the country. While Cuba has sent 500 doctors, who are working around the clock, US Imperialism has sent 16,000 troops. This criminal occupation has already been condemned by most countries in Latin America. The national organiser of HOV Denmark, Niklas Zenius Jespersen, then spoke: “20 years ago, the bourgeois commentators declared the end of history, and that Capitalism was the only possible system. But the events in the last 10 years in Latin America have proven this to be false. The development in Venezuela has shown that another world is not only necessary, but also possible. A world where wars, hunger, poverty, dictatorship, unemployment and environmental disasters are banished to the graveyard of history.” He also condemned the campaign in the mainstream media, who tries to slander the Venezuelan revolution and distort the conflict between the “democratic” Colombia and the “authoritarian” Venezuela. He said that this is a vicious lie from the private-owned media corporations. “Colombia is a country where three million people are internally displaced, where the army and paramilitary death squads are killing thousands of trade unionists, journalists, human rights activists, peasant and student leaders and members of the political opposition. It is not a democracy when people are voting with a gun barrel to their head.” He ended his speech by saying that the fight for Socialism is not just about completing the revolution in Venezuela, but it is a struggle about the future of the whole world: “The world economic crisis has shown that Capitalism with a human face is impossible – also in the West and in Denmark. (...) In Denmark the banking gangsters are handed billions in rescue packages – in Venezuela they are put in prison for their crimes. The crisis shows that Capitalism has failed. The labour movement in Denmark must learn from Latin America. Only by putting Socialism on the agenda, is it possible to maintain and expand the welfare society. By uniting the labour movement and mobilising an offensive struggle against the bourgeoisie and for Socialism, we can end cuts, wars and create a better society for all.” The revolutionary rap musician Tempo Bang gave a show, which was warmly applauded by the participants. The leader of the Danish-Cuban Association, Helene Caprani, then gave a speech: “This Saturday marks the anniversary of the defeat of another US-backed coup. A group of CIA-trained Cubans, who had left the country after the revolution, tried to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. They were defeated by a massive mobilisation on the part of the Cuban people. They were defeated in almost the same amount of time it took the Venezuelan people to defeat the coup against Chávez in Venezuela,” she said. She condemned the US blockade against Cuba and noted that even the UN has characterized the criminal blockade as “genocide”. She underlined that the real reason for the imperialists’ hatred towards Cuba is, that this poor country, through a different type of system, has managed to build an excellent health care system and that the Cuban revolution is an inspiration for poor people all over the world. At the picket, a message of solidarity from the Bolivian student front FERDE (Frente Estudiantil Revolucionario por el Derecho al Estudio) was read out. This message from Bolivia was warmly greeted and received a big applause. At the end of the picket, the organisers thanked the participants and expressed their hopes that this picket will serve to help the future work in Denmark in solidarity with the revolution in Latin America. The rap artist Tempo Bang – one of the finest rappers in the art of free style in Denmark – gave a marvellous show to end the event. HOV Denmark wants to thank our friends who helped to organise and fund this event, namely BUPL (Trade union for nursery workers), The Danish-Cuban Association, The Marxist journal Socialistisk Standpunkt , The No to War coalition, The Communist Party, The Communist Party in Denmark, The Danish Communist Party, The International Socialists, The Communist Platform, Marxist Students and the Salvador Allende Group.",NA,NA

													Fatkhul Khoir (Hands Off Venezuela Indonesia)"," In the industrial city Gresik, on October 18 th 2009, around twenty people gathered to watch and discuss the documentary No Volveran . This documentary tells a story about the Venezuelan Revolution and the struggle of the Sanitarios Maracay workers to occupy their factory and run it under workers’ control. The enthusiasm of those present was evident. This could be seen in the discussion following the screening. During the discussion, the attendee tried to draw a connection from what has been done by the trade unions in Venezuela. The screening was initiated by the trade union SPBI (Indonesian Workers Struggle Solidarity) in Gresik and Hands Off Venezuela Indonesia; Jesus S. Anam from HOV was present as a speaker. Jesus S. Anam explained the history of the movement in Venezuela and the gains of the workers movement there, and what has been done by the Venezuelan working class can be an inspiration for the workers in Indonesia, especially in Gresik. In this discussion, the attendee tried to reflect on the workers movement in Gresik. They said that they workers movement in Gresik is still very much trapped in normative issues and many of its leaders are dominated by yellow trade unions. Even though a common secretariat has been formed but this has yet to solve the needs of the workers. According to one of the attendee, the political situation had become less and less favorable for the workers, and the rampant outsourcing in Gresik as well as the apathy amongst the workers are the main obstacles in building the trade unions in Gresik. The fundamental problem faced by the workers is the absence of a revolutionary political leadership as a tool for struggle. The atomization of trade unions, according to another attendee, has also become a stumbling block for the workers’ struggle. Furthermore, the alliance building between trade unions has always been hindered by some trade union leaders who are more concerned about their existence and also a pragmatic attitude. At the end of the discussion, the audience who were pessimistic before became consolidated. After watching No Volveran , there was an agreement to close ranks by organizing political classes in the workers’ quarters regularly once every two weeks. The audience, the majority of whom were workers, truly got a fresh wind – that there is still a hope for the working class to struggle for a common welfare. Long live socialism! ",NA,NA

													HOV Canada"," On 29th September in Toronto, Hands Off Venezuela and the Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel” organized a film screening of the recent documentary produced by Vive TV about FRETECO. This latest documentary explores the revolutionary movement of occupied factories and workers’ control in Venezuela. At the core of the film, workers young and old, male and female, explain how they came to the realization that demanding nationalization under workers’ control is the only way forward for the Bolivarian Revolution. The film highlighted how the workers’ councils function, the role of communal councils, and the movement for trade unions of a new type. In particular, workers explain the fundamental differences between workplaces organized into co-operatives, and workplaces that have been nationalized under democratic workers’ control. Workers explained how co-operatives were still based on the capitalist profit motive, which means that their ultimate goal is to produce more profit for the workers/owners rather than focusing production, based on a centralized plan, to best meet the needs of their community. The workers in the film concluded that workers’ control of nationalized factories was the best option for Venezuelans to take back their power and produce goods for the well-being of all people. The members of FRETECO focused on their common goal -- eradicating capitalist production in order to transform the workplace. Democratic control by the workers will serve the community and advance the Bolivarian revolution. After the screening, the audience participated in a lively conversation and debate regarding the sustainability of democratic worker-controlled factories and the communal councils. In particular, some people shared their concerns about the global economic crisis and the impact on Venezuela’s oil wealth. HOV/Bolivarian Circle members Camilo Cahis and Maria Paez Victor explained that the development of multiple industries under workers’ control, and the partnerships with other Latin American countries such as Cuba, have been crucial to the development of many social programs such as health care and literacy programs. In addition, the revolutionary movements in neighbouring Latin American countries are critical for the development of more partnerships and trade with Venezuela. The revolutionary gains across Latin America will help secure and deepen the movements within Venezuela. Lastly, the Venezuelan Consul of Toronto, Mirna Quero de Peña, expressed her gratitude for the event to showcase to Canadians the many gains and victories of the Bolivarian Revolution. This film inspires Canadians to reflect on their own labour and social movements and take lessons from the victories of the Bolivarian Revolution. Hugo Chávez profoundly states that the best way for people to show solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution is to bring it to their own country. Hands Off Venezuela encourages activists from across the world to watch this movie to deepen our understanding of how ordinary people and workers can take control of their destiny to create a better life for the generations of today and tomorrow.

The event was graced by the presence of Adriana Gottberg, charge d'affaire of the Venezuelan Embassy to Hungary and Soraya Alvarez, the Cuban Ambassador to Hungary. After listening to the national anthems of both Hungary and Venezuela Adriana Gottberg welcomed the Congress and all in the hall. This was followed by András Simon, poet and translator, who welcomed the annual congress of the Hungarian-Venezuelan Solidarity Association. Congress accepted by a unanimous popular declaration a change to the constitution of the Hungarian-Venezuelan Solidarity Association so that András Simon could hold the post of honorary president of the HVSA. We listened to two poems presented by our friend, László Bóka. The first was by Ferenc Baranyi: ""Let's give it a name"", followed by Victor Valera Mora's ""I justify this war"". We asked two organisations, closely co-operating with us, to briefly greet our congress. In the last year we succeeded in establishing a good and close working relationship with these two youth organisations. Ádám Galba-Deák the president of the Democratic Network addressed the congress followed by András Bakó leader of the Budapest section of the Young Left Union - Young Communists of Hungary. It was a special honour that Zsolt Török, member of Parliament also conveyed his greetings to our congress. Many solidarity associations from abroad, left and communist organisations have sent greetings as well as every Venezuelan Solidarity Association, not only from Europe or Venezuela, but from even further afield, like India. We were especially happy to receive the good wishes of Eastern European left and communist parties, youth organisations. It gave us great joy to receive the greetings of the Greek communists, one Czech communist member of parliament as well as several communist members of the European Parliament. The last part of the congress was taken up by Kinga Kalocsai, president of the Hungarian-Venezuelan Solidarity Association presenting an evaluation of the activities of the last 12 months to those gathered together. ""In the last year we published more than 200 items of news and material on our web site, e-mail list, we reacted to biased reporting in several newspapers and even succeeded having our opinion published on occasions. We reached many people and achieved our goal of maintaining the information flow to those people about revolutionary events in Latin America"" - said Kinga Kalocsai. She outlined the future tasks of our organisation as well: ""I think that it is important to earmark a theme which we could examine in more detail. I feel this theme should be the Latin American trade union movement, factory occupation movement and the situation and participation of the workers in the Bolivarian movement. We not only have to present their struggle and position, but we must focus on the same theme in Hungary as well. We must draw attention to the differences, point out that while the working class of Venezuela consistently moves forward, winning new rights for itself, with assistance from the Venezuelan government, here in Hungary it is the exact opposite that is happening. There is ever increasing exploitation of the workers and unemployment is on the rise. We must make comparisons in other fields too. In the health service and in education. But I feel that it is extremely important for us to deal in depth with one topic and I propose that to be the position of the workers."" Congress elected its new leadership which in effect was reaffirming the majority of last year's leading bodies. The president of the Hungarian-Venezuelan Solidarity Association for the next year is Kinga Kalocsai. The executive members are: Julianna Grant, László Kupi and Péter Székely. The Control Commission members are: Réka Sós, Gábor Finta and Attila Trasciatti. Congress accepted a resolution, which can be read here . (In Hungarian) After the official business was over congress was addressed by Francesco Merli from the London Centre of Hands off Venezuela, who outlined the history of factory occupations in Venezuela, the situation of the Venezuelan trade unions and generally about the left in Latin America. This speech, which we hope will open a debate, is available here (in Hungarian). After Francesco's speech there was a long discussion and debate closing the 2009 Congress of the Hungarian-Venezuelan Solidarity Association. (September 29, 2009) ",NA,NA

													Maria Páez Victor (Bolivarian Circle ""Louis Riel""/Hands Off Venezuela)","Last week Hands Off Venezuela and the Louis Riel Bolivarian Circle, with help from our colleagues in Halifax, the National Council of Latin American and Caribbean Women in Canada, and the Venezuelan Consulate in Toronto, were able to bring to Toronto one of the most creative leaders of the Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution, Julio Chávez. Last week Hands Off Venezuela and the Louis Riel Bolivarian Circle, with help from our colleagues in Halifax, the National Council of Latin American and Caribbean Women in Canada, and the Venezuelan Consulate in Toronto, were able to bring to Toronto one of the most creative leaders of the Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution, Julio Chávez. He is not related to President Hugo Chávez, but is often referred to in his country as “the other Chávez”. Julio Chávez came to give Canadians a very clear message -- that the people of Venezuela have assumed control of their natural resources, their government, and their destiny by taking it -- through clean and transparent elections -- from wealthy elites, clients of global capital, who had marginalized the great majority of Venezuelan for the past 40 years. Venezuelans are creating a new state, one based on peace, human rights (both civil and social), and participatory democracy, which they call Socialism of the 21st Century. Julio Chávez demonstrated these points, not by talking of generalities, but by explaining in detail an example of this transformation: the changes he was a catalyst to in his own hometown of Carora, where he was mayor for four years. Carora is a town of about 100,000 people in the northwestern part of Venezuela, rural, agricultural, and cattle country. For centuries, its municipal affairs were in the hands of a handful of families but in 2004, Julio Chávez became the first mayor to be elected by a landslide with votes of the majority of the humble people of the area. He immediately realized that there was a disconnect between the municipal laws and ordinances, and the spirit and letter of the 2000 Constitution. That constitution was established by the national government of President Hugo Chávez through a uniquely participatory process that involved the election of a constitutional assembly, with a broad inclusion of diverse sectors such as rural workers, indigenous peoples, women, environmental groups, and workers. Julio Chávez set out to emulate this constitutional process in his municipality. He called forth a municipal constitutional assembly, which re-wrote all municipal laws and policies to coincide with the principals and letter of the national constitution. Today, Carora is the model for a new, participatory, socialist municipality that embodies the new Socialism of the 21st Century, that Venezuela hopes will profoundly change the bourgeois state. Its basic unit is the Communal Council, composed of 200-400 families in any one locality. The Communal Councils determine the community’s needs, receive the funds for, and execute projects to meet them. These councils are united in Territorial Communes which come together to exchange information, and determine the needs of the broader region. All the Communes meet in a general Assembly of the Communes, which ultimately determine the policies of the municipality. It is especially important to realize that even the municipal budget is determined and distributed by this Assembly. Indeed, it was the creative and participatory nature of the municipal budget process that elicited most questions when Julio Chávez spoke. We were energized and uplifted by Julio Chávez, and remain hopeful and optimistic that a new and better, more equal and peaceful world is being built by the Venezuelan people",NA,NA

			The Venezuelan Revolution at the Forum Social Québécois",2009-10-22T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela/Société Bolivarienne du Québec"," In the early morning of Sunday, 11th October, around 20 people attended a workshop presented by the Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela. “The Bolivarian Revolution: The truth and the myth” was one of many workshops which were presented by many social organizations during the five days of the Forum Social Québécois in Montreal from the 8th to the 12th of October. The presentation, given by comrade Ricardo, started with the historical background of the Venezuelan Revolution. In 1989, the army opened fire and killed between 275 to 3000 Venezuelans who took to the street in response to the austerity measures by the government of Carlos Andréz Pérez. This bloody event, known as the Caracazo, marked a turning point in the history of Venezuela. A section of the army who were dissatisfied that they were ordered to kill their own people attempted a coup in 1992. The coup failed but from this emerged Hugo Chávez who immediately became the figure whom the poor masses of Venezuela saw as their genuine leader. In 1998, Chávez won the presidential election and since then, the movement has won more than ten democratic elections. Ricardo then proceeded to talk about the social missions that were implemented and have brought millions of people out of poverty and misery. The one unique feature of the missions is that they are being organized by the communities themselves, thereby bypassing the bureaucracy that is the inheritance of the previous government. This is not free of danger though. With the economic crisis affecting Venezuela, the government, still resting on the market economy, has been forced to cut many of these popular social missions. At the end of the presentation, the floor was opened for discussion. One member of the audience asked about Chávez’s support of undemocratic regimes like Iran and terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. A healthy debate then ensued where one of the HOV members pointed out that the Bolivarian revolution is not homogenous and that there isn’t full agreement on all of the government’s actions. Some revolutionaries believe that the stance that the Venezuelan government has taken, especially towards the revolution in Iran, will ultimately hurt the revolution in Venezuela and can endanger international solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution from other revolutionaries abroad (see Solidarity with the movement of the Iranian masses – Statement of the Revolutionary Marxist Current in Venezuela ). Indeed there is nothing progressive at all with Hamas and Hezbollah; if the Palestinian and Lebanese masses offer a significant amount of support to these groups now, it is only because there is an absence of a revolutionary alternative and leadership in these countries. One of the HOV members present reminded the audience that the revolution is far from finished. The economy is still in the hands of the capitalists who are actively sabotaging the economy in order to undermine the revolution. The majority of the media is still in the hands of the oligarchy that spews lies and slanders to strangle the revolution. The state is still filled with bureaucratic and corrupt elements that are inherited from the old 4th Republic, who actively sabotage the revolution from within. The threat of counter-revolution is real, and the revolution has to move forward: expropriate the oligarchy, and dismantle the old state and build a new form of state based on the communal councils and factory committees. Following the morning workshop on the Bolivarian revolution, the SBQ/HOV organized a documentary screening about the struggle of the women workers from the Brukman factory in Argentina who took over their factory and run it under workers’ control. The screening of “The Women of Brukman” was attended by around 15-20 people, with special guest Isaac Isitan, the producer of the documentary. “The Women of Brukman” tells a story how the workers in the Brukman garment factory took over their factory after the owners abandoned them in 2001 after the major economic collapse in Argentina. The bosses left the workers without pay and compensation, forcing the workers to run the factory themselves. This courageous story of the women in Brukman has become a national point of reference for the factory occupation movement in Argentina. ",NA,NA

													Bosnian and Herzegovinian-Venezuelan solidarity association"," Banja Luka 22 July 2009 Members of the Initiative assembly The BiH-Venezuelan Solidarity Association was established at the time of the coup in Honduras supported by imperialist powers, when the USA is negotiating with Colombia on the takeover of military bases. All these events are an attack on the Bolivarian revolution, the democratic regime of Venezuela, the people of Venezuela and on social equality by foreign imperialist powers and local oligarchs, with the intention of re-establishing the regime of exploitation against the Venezuelan people, resources and in order to capture markets. Many lies are published via the media about the Venezuelan government, which is characterised as a dictatorship. Many untruths are published, and people have no a real idea of the events taking place in Venezuela. We are determined to campaign in defence of the Bolivarian revolution against the attacks of the imperialist powers in order to defend the democratic government of Hugo Chavez and to fight for the truth. In Venezuela there are youth, aided by money from the imperialist countries, who are campaigning against the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, and such is the situation in many European countries. The imperialist powers, primarily the USA, have trained and paid youth to lead demonstrations and attempt to bring down governments that harm the foreign policy of the USA. We had just such a situation not so long ago in our neighbouring country, the consequences of which they can now see: the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has disintegrated, Montenegro has become a satellite of foreign oligarchs and Serbia has lost a part of its territory that belongs to neither the Albanians nor Serbs, but to NATO! BiH is a country, arisen from SFRY, which was a democratic socialist state, where there was no exploitation of people, where there was no class stratification, where there was no social insecurity. Our state was destroyed by the imperialist powers and domestic traitors who are against social equality and democratic socialism. This is the situation - but hear: The imperialist powers are pressing from all sides, through various blocks and with the help of domestic traitors, managers, oligarchs etc., destroyed our economy in order to prove that socialism is a bad system and in order to get support from the people. It will take a long time to recover from this, but if we learn the lessons, such experiences can contribute to strengthening the campaign to defend the Bolivarian revolution against imperialist attack. For these reasons, comrade Dusko Malešević, General Secretary of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with his friends and comrades, convened a Steering Committee where it was decided to establish a BiH-Venezuelan Solidarity Association in this area and help the campaign. The basic principles of the Campaign are: Aim: a) presenting Venezuelan policy to the citizens of BiH, b) Answering the lies of the imperialist media and the attacks on the Venezuelan revolution c) opposition to imperialist intervention in Venezuela d) Giving full support to the Venezuelan Revolution, which has repeatedly proved its democratic credentials in its struggle to liberate the oppressed of Venezuela. e) Supporting the right of the Venezuela people to self-determination f) Counter-acting the media distortions and lies about Venezuela and mobilising maximum support for the above aims. g) Comparing Socialism of the 21st Century with the political system in BiH and SFRY h) For social equality i) Implementing of democracy in BiH j) BiH-Venezuelan solidarity will organise a campaign In BiH, membership will be open to all individuals (over 18 years of age) members, groups and affiliated organisations the activities or programme of which are not opposed to this campaign. A member of HoV cannot be a member of another organisation which is opposed to HoV. Membership is formed by signing the contract and legalised when it is accepted by the Board. HoV is made up of individual members, groups and affiliated organisations, which will be represented at the annual conference. Voting at conference will take place on the basis of one member - one vote.

Most importantly, the importance of advancing the efforts of our international campaign in Canada was stressed. Mr. Vitriago was pleased to learn about recent successes of our campaign and HOV's merger with Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel” in Toronto. It was discussed that at a later stage, we may be able to produce an English version of Bolivarien, the French-Spanish paper of the Consulate which is currently being published in Montreal. We did discuss some of our disagreements with Chávez and the Bolivarian government and their stance toward the Iranian regime which, unlike the Venezuelan revolutionary government, is a vicious anti-worker and reactionary theocracy. We stressed the fact that we understand the natural needs of the Bolivarian government to have trade partnerships with every possible country (and this is an absolute right for Venezuela), but that there is a big difference between diplomatic relations and calling the Ahmadinejad regime “anti-imperialist” and “revolutionary”. In the final analysis, the real friends of the Venezuelan revolution are the Iranian masses. What was most interesting was the extremely friendly and down-to-earth attitude of the Consul General and all of the other people at the Consulate. They were incredibly hospitable and we were not only given a warm welcome but some wonderful Venezuelan coffee, cookies, and a disc of Venezuelan music produced by the Consulate. Unlike all the capitalist statesmen and diplomats, the attitude of Consulate staff was one of comradeship toward us as young workers and activists. This fundamental difference, I believe, is not because of some sort of cultural difference, but because of the fact that in Venezuela, there is a revolution taking place in which even President Chávez has opened the debate about socialism. Many amongst the new diplomatic staff appointed by Chávez are committed revolutionaries and therefore see us as their international comrades.",NA,NA

			Noam Chomsky Meets with Chavez in Venezuela",2009-09-04T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Venezuelanalysis.com"," Mérida, August 27 th 2009 (Venezuelanalysis.com) -- U.S. author, dissident intellectual, and Professor of Linguistics at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology Noam Chomsky met for the first time with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Caracas and analyzed hemispheric politics during a nationally televised forum on Monday. Chomsky is well known in Venezuela for his critiques of U.S. imperialism and support for the progressive political changes underway in Venezuela and other Latin American countries in recent years. President Chavez regularly references Chomsky in speeches and makes widely publicized recommendations of Chomsky's 2003 book, Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance . ""Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival,"" said Chavez in a press conference to welcome Chomsky. He compared Chomsky's thesis to that of German socialist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 1900s, ""Socialism or Barbarism,"" and referred to Chomsky as ""one of the greatest defenders of peace, one of the greatest pioneers of a better world."" Through an interpreter, Chomsky responded, ""I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that's easy. What's harder is to create a better world... and what's so exciting about at last visiting Venezuela is that I can see how a better world is being created."" During Monday's forum, which was broadcast on the state television station VTV, Chomsky pointed out that the ongoing coup in Honduras, which began on June 28 th , is the third coup the United States has supported in Latin America so far this century, following the coup against Chavez in 2002 and Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. The nearly finalized deal to allow the U.S. to increase its military presence on Colombian bases ""is only part of a much broader effort to restore Washington's capacity for intervention,"" said Chomsky. According to Chomsky, the region has the capacity to unite and form a ""peace zone"" in which foreign militaries are forbidden to operate. ""Venezuela can help to advance this proposal, but it cannot do it alone,"" he said. ""The transformations that Venezuela is making toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out,"" said the renowned author. Aporrea.org, a popular Venezuelan news and pro-revolution analysis website, described Chomsky as oriented toward ""libertarian socialism"" and ""vehemently anti-Stalinist"" in an introduction to a recent interview in which Chomsky said U.S. President Barack Obama's foreign policy will be similar to that of the second administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush. Chomsky addressed this issue during Monday's conference as well, commenting that Obama ""could have much to offer Latin America if he wanted to, but hasn't given any signals that he does."" He cited the U.S.'s indecisive posture toward the coup in Honduras as evidence. Chomsky also addressed the media and freedom of expression in the U.S. ""In the United States the socio-economic system is designed so that the control over the media is in the hands of a minority who own large corporations... and the result is that the financial interests of those groups are always behind the so-called freedom of expression,"" he said. Chomsky said the growing disappointment with the Obama administration in the U.S. was predictable because the corporate media marketed Obama's presidential candidacy on the slogan of ""Change We Can Believe In"" but omitted concrete proposals for effective changes, and the Obama administration has since shown an incapacity to institute such changes. Chomsky was accompanied in Caracas by the co-founder of South End Press and ZMagazine and system operator of ZCom, Michael Albert, and the co-founder and editor of Venezuelanalysis.com, sociologist Gregory Wilpert.

			Montreal: HOV/SBQ in solidarity with the people of Honduras",2009-07-04T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ted Sprague (Hands Off Venezuela/Société Bolivarian du Quebéc)"," A classic military coup which the Latin America people have witnessed for almost 100 years took place again on Sunday, June 28. This time it took place in Honduras where democratically elected Honduras president, José Manuel Zelaya, was kidnapped by the military and taken to Costa Rica. The oligarch, the high command of the Army, the right-wing dominated Congress, and the tops of the judiciary collaborated to oust Zelaya and install their own ""democratic"" regime. Just like in Venezuela back in 2002, the masses responded by coming out on the streets to demand the return of their president. Not only in the streets of Honduras, all over the world people have staged rallies in solidarity with the struggle of the Honduras people. Here in Montreal, two solidarity rallies have been organized by Latin America solidarity groups whereby Hands Off Venezuela/Société Bolivarian du Quebéc supported and joined. The coup plot has been brewing since president Zelaya called for a referendum to form a Constituent Assembly. In fact the coup has been in the air since Zelaya started taking measures to alleviate the suffering of the Honduras masses such as signing an agreement with Venezuela and Cuba to import cheap generic drugs, therefore cutting the profit of the pharmaceutical multinationals that control 80% of the drug market, embarking on national literacy campaign, cutting of interest rates for small farmers, and increasing of minimum wage. At the same time, he took away some of the most glaring privileges that had been exploited by the Honduras ruling class. These reasonable reforms cannot be accepted by the oligarch as they tried to keep every penny to themselves. Politically these reforms were also seen to be dangerous to their rule as they can embolden the masses to be more confident and demand more changes. On Monday (June 29) and Wednesday (July 1), an ad-hoc ""Committee against the coup in Honduras"" organized solidarity rallies. This call was supported by Hands Off Venezuela/Société Bolivarian du Quebéc and other Latin America solidarity groups (Acción y Solidaridad por Colombia (ASOCOLOM); Comisión de Solidaridad Internacional de la Asociación de chilenos de Quebec; FMLN Montreal; S.O.S. Salvador). In short notice, more than 50 people came out to demand the return of Zelaya and denounced this military coup. Members of Tendance Marxiste Internationale were also present with their banner, La Riposte . Flags from countries such as Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Cuba, and Brazil were present in the rallies, showing the support of the whole Latin America people for the Honduras masses. People were chanting ""Non au coup d'État au Honduras"", ""Uh Ah Zelaya no se va"", and ""Harper exigez le retour du president, ne soyez pas complice"" to voice their opposition to the coup and demanding the prime minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, to ask for the return of Zelaya as the only legitimate president of Honduras. The rallies attracted many passers-by who were curious and asking questions about what is happening in Honduras. Jorge Martin (the International Secretary of Hands Off Venezuela) in his recent article, Defeat the reactionary military coup in Honduras , pointed out correctly that ""only through the mass mobilisation of the workers and peasants can the coup be defeated. Such a mass movement must also make an appeal to the rank and file soldiers to refuse to follow orders from their officers. Hugo Chávez posed it thus: ‘Soldier, empty out your rifle against the oligarchy and not against the people.'"" The April 2002 coup in Venezuela was smashed by the workers, peasants, and the urban poor, and also the low-rank soldiers who joined the movement. This is an example that is now being taken by the Honduras masses as they came out on the streets now fighting fiercely to reinstall their president, and there has been report of workers' strikes as well. HOV/SBQ stand in full solidarity with the workers and peasants of Honduras. We call: Down with the reactionary coup in Honduras! Mass mobilisation on the streets and a general strike! Soldiers, turn your weapons against your officers and join the side of the people! {mosframe http://www.flickr.com/photos/lariposte/sets/72157620874070298/show/#slideshow,100%,550} ",NA,NA

We are firmly against the recent illegal coup d etat in Honduras. We call for the rescue and return of the democratically elected president Zelaya. We support the statements made from President Chavez and president Moraleas and other regional leaders regarding this matter. We believe that the reason for the coup d etat is Honduras decision to join ALBA and move closer towards the position of the other left-wing governments in the region. This is a threat to USA imperialistic interest in the region. According to an article by Eva Golinger the way this coup d etat has been carried through shows many similarities with the coup d etat in Venezuela 2002. Since president Obama so far has only said that he is “concerned” with the situation in Honduras this imply that the US administration has been deeply involved in this coup d etat. This shows that threat of US imperialism and the oligarchy in Latina America has not gone away. We must struggle against what have happened in Honduras. We must build links with the people in Honduras who are against the coup. But we need to draw the right conclusion we must not make steps backward under the threat from imperialism.

			Second Latin American Meeting of Worker-Recovered Factories: ""Our solidarity is permanent""",2009-07-06T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Geoff McCormack - Hands Off Venezuela"," The Second Latin American Meeting of Worker-Recovered Factories took place on June 25-27. Over two hundred workers gathered at the National Library in Caracas to discuss perspectives for the occupied factories movement internationally. Worker representatives were present from all over the world, including Paraguay, Bolivia, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Turkey, Iraq and Canada. Leading activists from Mitsubishi, Vivex, Inveval, the newly nationalized La Gaviota, the Cabelum factory in Guayana, the Front of Health sector workers' of Lara, the trade-union in CEMEX and many more unions and occupied factories were present. A number of lea d ing Bolivian trade-unionists of the COB (Central Workers' Federation), the Central Obrera Departamental de Oruro and of the FSTMB (Miners Trade-Union Federation) unfortunately had to send apologies for various reasons. At 2:00 p.m. on June 25 the opening meeting officially began. After a few remarks, Serge Goulart (the national coordinator of the Occupied Factories Movement in Brazil) introduced the first speaker. Eduardo Samán, the Venezuelan Minster of Commerce, spoke at length about the need to deepen the revolution in Venezuela. World capitalism is in crisis, he said, and “we can’t expect that it will collapse on its own.” To this end he called on working people to organise to defend and deepen the revolution in Venezuela. He ended his talk by reaffirming the importance of the meeting in building a collective memory of workers’ shared experience. The minister was presented with several gifts, including The Battle of Inveval: The Struggle for Workers’ Control in Venezuela by Pablo Cormenzana, a militant of the IMT in Venezuela. César Gonzáles, coordinator of the worker-recovered factories in Paraguay, also presented the minister with a film about Cerámica Itauguá – a ceramics plant in Paraguay occupied by its workers. Lalo Paret of the National Movement of Occupied Factories in Argentina also spoke at the meeting. He discussed the importance of distinguishing between workers’ cooperatives and the nationalisation of factories under workers’ control. Cooperatives do not address the problem of capitalism. If workers run a business under the cooperative model they will be forced to adhere to the competitive logic of capitalism. Nationalisation under workers’ control, on the other hand, ensures that workers’ interests are not subjected to the dictates of the market. Instead of the factory belonging only to the workers who work there, it belongs to all workers – to society as a whole. This was an important lesson learned from the Argentinean experience. Luis Primo from FRETECO spoke next. He is also an organising member of both the First and Second Latin American Meetings of Worker-Recovered Factories and is a well-known unionist in the UNT. He emphasised that one of the major problems facing the working class in Venezuela and abroad is how to transform capitalist management into working-class management. So far workers have learned about workers’ control; now they have to learn about workers’ management. Workers also have to learn know to “articulate the national with the international,” he said. A representative from La Gaviota, a recently expropriated sardine plant, also spoke at the meeting. Pascuala talked about the difficulties she and her co-workers faced when they decided to occupy their factory. At first it was difficult because they lacked raw materials. Many workers became discouraged and didn’t think they could do it. Eventually the materials came through and confirmed to them that workers “can do it, united and together.” They discovered that they can continue production under workers’ control. “We can do it without the bosses” she said. Workers now decide how much is produced and where it is sent. “Now we do everything – and we get to eat the sardines!” Félix Martínez, the general secretary of the Union of the New Generation of Mitsubishi Workers (SINGETRAM) spoke next about the police brutality that ended in the death of two comrades. “Before Chavez,” he said, “unions had [absolutely] no support.” Activists were beaten up or killed regularly. Chavez has been able to provide some support to struggling workers in Venezuela. Since the death of the two Mitsubishi workers, however, the economic fight has been transformed into a political one; and this requires ideological vigilance. “Now that we have met the IMT”, he said, “we have learned to be vigilant about ideology. We are going to make a school for workers.” He also talked about the importance of the exchange of ideas between workers of different countries in the fight for socialism. We need unions with more democracy and leaders who will fight for workers to ensure that the needs of the group are met. Most importantly, he insisted, the means of production need to be transferred to the workers. “We are part of the development towards worldwide socialism. I am completely convinced that this is the only way forward – collectively. Our solidarity is permanent.” After Félix spoke a moment of silence was observed for the two fallen workers at Mitsubishi, and for all workers who have been persecuted or killed. The last speaker of the day was Jorge Paredes, the president of the union at Inveval. Miembro del consejo de fábrica de Inveval y trabajadores Presidente de Inveval. He spoke about the importance of eliminating private property and of combating bureaucracy and the state. He also discussed how the umbrella organisation, FRETECO, will be an important factor in organising these fights. On the second day reports were given on the state of workers’ movements in various countries. Representatives from Iraq, Canada, Turkey and Paraguay reported on the situation in their respective countries. Following the international reports, Pablo Cormenzana, the author of The Battle of Inveval , spoke about the Venezuelan revolution and the struggle of occupied factories. Pablo stressed that the central point for the workers’ revolution in Venezuela is the occupied factories movement. But unfortunately workers in Venezuela cannot count on the state to fight in their interests. There are elements within the government that represent the interests of the bourgeoisie, and the case of Inveval reveals this clearly. “It is a microcosm of the class struggle,” he said. It has been nationalized for four years but it is not producing at full-scale, only repairing valves because of sabotage on the part of the bureaucracy. In spite of the fact that Chávez has hailed Inveval as an example to follow, signed the decree for its budget and also for the expropriation of Acerven (the sister-factory – a smelter which is vital for production in Inveval), none of this has been carried out and the bureaucracy is deliberately sabotaging Inveval. This highlights the need for stepping up an international solidarity campaign . Likewise in Venezuelan society workers’ needs are not being met. The bureaucracy still poses a great threat and barrier to the revolution. Yet with the economic crisis the situation is getting more and more dangerous; and this is bringing the question of leadership to the fore. The working class needs to finish the revolution – it needs to take power. This is why organising the factory councils on a national level is so important. The second day ended with a debate on private property versus social property. The debate was lively with many interventions from the floor. Luis Primo chaired the discussion. Gerardo Xicotencatl, trade-union leader at Olympia – an occupied factory in Mexico and the centre of one of the key struggles in that country – spoke on the political and social situation in Mexico in general and the concrete struggle at Olympia in particular. On the third day there was a discussion on the repression of workers in all countries. Workers spoke about their experiences in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. Josie from Brazil described the plight of students in her country as well . In the end it was proposed that an international tribunal be created on the question of the criminalization of social movements and the repression of workers around the world. This was accepted unanimously. A special resolution of solidarity with the masses of Iran was also discussed and voted unanimously. This resolution condemns the reactionary Islamic regime and hails the revolutionary movement that has taken to the streets in spite of harsh repression. This shows that the workers of Latin America are following events in Iran and are in complete solidarity with their fighting class brothers and sisters in Iran. Another resolution, demanding that president Lula of Brazil give back Cipla and Interfibra to the workers, was also passed. A final declaration of the meeting will be available shortly, including an addendum with international greetings from the meeting to various countries. The balance-sheet of this meeting is overwhelmingly positive. It was a continuation of the first meeting which was celebrated in October 2005. But this time, the political situation on a world scale places it on a qualitatively higher level. On the one hand because the workers felt that they themselves had organized and financed this gathering. On the other hand because the economic crisis of capitalism is pushing new layers into struggle and these struggles are becoming increasingly militant in nature. Thus, it is necessary to link them together and build unity among workers, also on an international level. The last decision of the meeting was that the third gathering should be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and to have an international character, not just involving Latin American countries, but also Europe, The Middle East, Asia and Africa.

													HOV Finland"," DECLARATION A coup d'état has today taken place in Honduras. Our information tells us president Manuel Zelaya has been fetched from his home in the early hours of the morning, by miltary force, and taken, still in pyjamas, to an aircraft, which then carried him to Costa Rica. The Supreme Court of Honduras has announced they have approved of this action, the congress has been read a forged letter of resignation from the president, and they have named another person as acting president. However, president Zelaya has spoken in the international media, confirming he still is Honduran president. The supreme court does not elect a president, neither does a congress or a parliament; it doesn't happen thus in Finland, nor in Honduras. President is elected by the people.. We condemn with utmost indignation the illegal actions above, and presume president Zelaya will soonest be invited back to his country and to his post It was intended that a non-binding referendum be executed today in Honduras of whether a a constitutional assembly should be called to convene, and this process has been strongly resisted by some political parties. According to our information, 400 000 hondurans have undersigned a petition asking for this referendum to be organized. We regard, in such circumstances, democracy demands the vote be allowed to happen. Hindering a vote by military force, instead, is a clearly undemocratic, shameful act. Some information tells us the cuban and venezuelan ambassadors to Honduras have been beaten, also by the military. Thus, diplomatic immunity granted by Vienna convention, has been breached. Evidently the foreign minister, Patricia Rodas, has been snatched, too. We hope legality be reinstated in Honduras soonest. Coup d'états have a long and bloody tradition in Latin America, it is high time to absolutely forsake such methods ! And condemn those who commit them, as well as those who will accept them. Who continuously pay lipsevice to freedom and democracy, may they now raise their voices and demand the immediate return of president Manuel Zelaya, elected by his people, to his presidential post, and a condition of legality and democracy to again reign in Honduras.

													VN"," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm a member of Iranian branch of ""Hands Off Venezuela"" campaign. I always observe carefully and defend the revolutionary process in this country (I mean the wave of nationalizations, factory occupations, the workers' control on the plants, social programs, struggles against bureaucracy, corruption, capitalism and Yankee imperialism and of course, crumbling the national landlords and bourgeoisie etc); I try to report what is truly taking place in this country, because in the western and bourgeois media, there is an unbelievably massive misinformation about the current state of Venezuela and especially President Hugo Chavez. Some years ago, everyone including me had faced with a critical question; the question was: what does the socialism of 21 st century or the ""Bolivarian Socialism"" mean? And how can it be built in Venezuela or in any country around the world now? That was a very important question, since as you know, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Berlin Wall, a well-known ideologist like Francis Fokoyama had come out with the Slogan ""The end of the history"" and ""the death of socialism and the triumph of Liberal Democracy"". Now I'm confident that such claimed were/are nonsense; I'm observing that how the genuine socialism is being made in practice and from below (i.e. by the working class, the women, the poor, the peasants and so on) Therefore, from this aspect, Venezuelan Revolution is a remarkable experience; it is a marvelous example of building a society on the basis of socialism. The Bolivarian Socialism is really, with no exaggeration, a source of inspiration for all the workers and the oppressed around the world. But I should immediately add that I permanently and firmly criticize President Chavez for his close relationship with the Islamic Republic. The progressive state of Venezuela and the reactionary regime of Iran are moving in two completely different ways: One to the Left and another to the right. So, such a close relationship will have no justification. I emphasize again, it will have no justification. The Islamic Republic is the cradle of repression, torture, prison, corruption; it is an ultra-rightist government which is attempting to integrate into world capitalism. It is not anti-imperialist; by contrast it is utterly in the service of ""imperialism"", i.e. IMF, WB, WTO, G8 and US. In other words, it is the puppet of imperialist powers. So such a close relationship between President Chavez and the Iranian authorities will just undermine and cover the achievements of 10 years of revolution in Venezuela. I know that President Chavez is going to create an anti-imperialist bloc, but it is clear that he can never reach this gain by the help of Iran. That is what I ask President Chaves and all pro-Bolivarian Revolution to reflect on. ",NA,NA

													Latin America Solidarity Network - Toronto"," Brothers and Sisters: The Latin American Solidarity Network calls on Toronto's progressive organizations and individuals to participate in a rally that will take place at: Thursday, July 2 nd , 2009 at 12:00 p.m. In front of the office of MP Bob Rae, (Foreign Affairs Critic for the Liberal Party) 514 Parliament Street (just north of Carlton) Our goal is to demonstrate our repudiation of the coup d'etat that took place in Honduras last Sunday and present our demands to the Canadian government for the return of President Manuel Zelaya to his country and the restoration of his democratically elected government. We are certain that we can count on the solidarity and participation of many organizations and individuals who believe in democracy. A public letter: The Latin American Solidarity Network--Toronto, in consideration of the news that the President of Honduras, Manuel, Zelaya, removed from his position by a military coup, will return to his country on Thursday, July 2, has the duty to demand that the Canadian government do the following: Refuse to recognize the illegitimate ""government"" of Roberto Michelletti or any other government of a similar character. Demand that coupist leaders recognize President Zelaya as the constitutional president of Honduras and accept his return. If this does not occur, Canada should withdraw its ambassador, following the example set by Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Nicaragua. Demand the immediate lifting of the State of Emergency and the end to all acts of repression again the Honduran people. Canada should demand the liberty of all the democratic leaders that have been detained illegally. In the case of the return of President Manuel Zelaya, the government of Canada should pay strict attention to the following points: The personal security of President Zelaya should be guaranteed at all times. President Zelaya should continue with his democratizing project in the country that was interrupted by the coup. There should be punishment for those responsible for the coup, who have blocked the democratic process in Honduras, assassinated and repressed those who resisted, and cowardly abused the Foreign Minister of Honduras and the ambassadors from Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. The Armed Forces of Honduras should be democratized so that they can never again usurp the sovereignty of the people. The Latin American Solidarity Network declares that the defeat of this military coup will demonstrate how much has changed in Latin America this past decade. Today there is no room for the oligarchy and military leaders to dictate the destiny of the people. There is no room for another Pinochet or for any coups like the one that occurred in Haiti. In our opinion, the eventual return of President Zelaya will be product of the strong repudiation of the coup leaders by the international community and, in particular, the decisive action and solidarity of the governments of Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, the member countries of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the peoples of Our America), the Rio Group, and the heroic resistance of the Honduran people. The Latin American Solidarity Network strongly appreciates the timely response to the coup by the various Latin American and progressive organizations in Toronto and the country. In our opinion, with the return of constitutional president of Honduras, we must remain vigilant regarding further events and remain coordinated so that with short notice we can raise our voices to denounce any attempts at repression in Honduras.

We strongly reject this reactionary military coup against the legitimate government of Zelaya. The immediate reason for the coup was the attempt by Zelaya to call a Constituent Assembly in order to reform the country's constitution. Zelaya's government had carried out a whole series of progressive reforms in the fields of education, health care, breaking the monopoly of the multinationals in the pharmaceutical and oil sector, increased minimum wage by 60% and therefore had the support of the majority of workers, peasants and the poor. Zelaya's government had brought Honduras into the ALBA and had aligned itself with the progressive governments of Venezuela, Bolivia, etc. The masses have come out on the streets and called for a general strike on Monday 29 to reject this coup.

													Ted Sprague"," Garcia government ordered a violent attack against the indigenous people of the Amazon who had been blockading the Fernando Belaúnde Terry highway near the northern city of Bagua. This blockade was organized in opposition to the recent opening up of the Peruvian Amazon forest for the exploitation of energy, mineral resources, and logging. Over the weekend, an estimated 30 to 50 indigenous activists were killed and hundreds injured when the Peruvian police forces launched an air and ground assault using live ammunition. On the other side, more than 20 police died in the clashes according to the official government report. Across Canada, demonstrations were organized to condemn the massacre of these indigenous protesters. The recent decree for the opening up of the Amazon forest for exploitation, without the consultation of the indigenous people living there, is an integral part of the Free Trade Agreement signed with Washington. The indigenous people of the Amazon have been fighting relentlessly against these decrees for more than a year. There is no doubt that Alan Garcia, under pressure from the US government and multinational corporations who wish to exploit the forest, sought to end the resistance forcefully, and this he did on June 5 th by ordering the massacre. Throughout Peru and across the world, the people responded to this brutal massacre by staging solidarity demonstrations. In Canada, demonstrations were organized in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign supported these rallies. In Montreal, the Hands Off Venezuela/Bolivarian Society of Quebec helped organize a rally on Friday, June 12 th , with fellow solidarity organizations, Action Creative and the Mohawk Traditional Council of Kahnawake. In front of the Peruvian consulate, more than 50 people were present to show their solidarity with the struggle of Amazonian indigenous people and condemn Alan Garcia and his government for their brutal massacre. These solidarity rallies across the world have united the workers, peasants, students, and indigenous people around a common cause. As capitalism enters into its deepest crisis, the assault against indigenous people, workers, peasants, and students is intensifying. Capitalism is entering into a blind alley and in panic it is destroying everything in its sights to save itself. Millions have lost their jobs and houses. The people and the earth are being exploited at a faster rate and in an increasingly brutal fashion in order to maintain the falling rate of profit of the capitalists. This recent massacre of the Peruvian indigenous people is just one example of this. The capitalists are taking full offensive measures now to save their profit. The people need to take offensive measures as well: going beyond capitalism and toward socialism. The indigenous workers and peasants of Bolivia have shown the way forward by fighting for socialism, the only social system that can protect the earth and respect the rights, traditions, and cultures of the native people of America.

The coup took place just hours before the people of Honduras go out to vote on a consultative referendum concerning whether to rewrite the constitution. The current Honduran Constitutionm which was written in 1982 during the height of the US administration’s dirty war in Central America, was designed to ensure the ruling elite who have closed ties with the imperialist US to consolidate their powers with little interference from the ordinary people. The consultative referendum proposed by President Manuel Zelaya is merely an opinion poll for the Hondurans to determine whether they are prepared to enter into a democratic process to modify their constitution. The referendum though is a not-binding vote, has been viewed by many unions and peasant groups as a necessary precursor to economic reforms favoring Honduras's poor majority. Yet, the right-wing political elites are threatened by it and used every mean to stop the people of Honduras to determine their future by themselves. President Manuel Zelaya, elected in 2005, has increasingly come under attack by the right-wing forces in Honduras for his growing relationship with the ALBA countries. The coup is clearly a corwadice act by the right-wing political elite and US-backed economic interests which in fear of losing their grip on this Central American country when it move closer with countries which are now undergoing revolutionary process like Venezuela. PSM calls for: 1) Restore democracy in Honduras 2) Immediately reinstate the democratically elected President Zelaya 3) People of Honduras have their right to determine whether to re-write the out-dated imperialist influenced consitution in order to restructure its society for the benefit of ordinary vast majority.

													Cora James (HOV Toronto/Bolivarian Circle ""Louis Riel"")"," On Tuesday, 9 June, sixty people crowded into Ryerson University’s Oakham House in Toronto (Canada) to hear Jorge Martín, the international secretary of Hands off Venezuela (HOV), speak about the history of Cuba, and the prospects for Cuba’s future. The event was organized by HOV Toronto/Bolivarian Circle ""Louis Riel"", with endorsements from the Venezuelan and Cuban consulates and the Toronto Forum on Cuba. The event started with a rousing speech by Jorge Sorberon, the Cuban consul, who spoke about the gains of the Cuban revolution. He said that it has been 50 years since the start of the revolution, and still the gains of the revolution are evident in society—people have free health care, education, housing, etc. Following this speech, Maura Rivas, the Venezuelan vice consul, stood up to speak about the need for solidarity with the people of Peru where there has been a massacre of indigenous people, as well as the people of Mexico, who have recently experienced a tragedy with the loss of forty-four lives in a daycare. The crowd then held a moment of silence to remember these losses, and reflect on the need for international solidarity. Afterward, Rivas expressed the need to overcome the economic blockade of Cuba, and the importance of connecting all Latin American countries with each other. Maria Paez Victor, a leading member of the Bolivarian Circle Louis Riel, followed on Rivas’ thoughts by pointing to the exchanges that have occurred between Cuba and Venezuela. For both of the revolutions to survive, they must not exist in isolation. Maria spoke about how illiteracy has been abolished in Venezuela, and how Venezuela is now exchanging oil for doctors with Cuba. After the introductory remarks were complete, Jorge Martín addressed the crowd. He began by listing the incredible gains of the Cuban revolution. He used statistics and data to point out the achievements of the Cuban revolution in contrast to the situations facing many advanced, capitalist countries; for example, the life expectancy in Cuba is 77.7 years, while the life expectancy in the USA is 77.9 years. Jorge then placed these statistics in the context of Cuban history, and pointed out that in order for a revolution to succeed, there needs to be a break with capitalism. He referenced Venezuela on this matter. Jorge summed up his talk by speaking about the Cuban situation today. He spoke about the system of dual currency, self employment, and the opening up of Cuban markets to foreign capital; he pointed out that Cuba did these things because it could not survive in isolation after the fall of the USSR, but that at the same time they have introduced many distortions in the economy. He then addressed how the world crisis of capitalism is affecting Cuba, and how tropical storms last year led to a important losses for the Cuban economy. He pointed out how capitalism was undermining the Cuban economy through unequal terms of trade and therefore the urgent need to spread socialism to other countries as a guarantee for the defence of the Cuban revolution And finally, he spoke about US relations with Cuba. Jorge Martin ended on an optimistic note, though—hopeful for an international revolution. Following a Q&A session, Jorge Martín referenced a speech by Fidel Castro, who said that the main danger facing the Cuban revolution comes from inside, from the possibility of bureaucracy and corruption, and from its own mistakes. Jorge finished the entire event with a quote from Che Guevara, when he said that in Latin America the bourgeoisie could not play a progressive role and that it was a question of ""socialist revolution or an abortion of a revolution"", which led to enthusiastic applause. After the speeches there was a lively and enjoyable discussion. The audience cheered at the mention of the OAS’s decision to nullify its expulsion of Cuba in 1962, and as well for Cuba's decision not to want to rejoin such a body. All in all it was a successful event which further strengthens the unity of the Cuban and Venezuelan solidarity movements. ",NA,NA

													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela"," U.S. Hands Off Venezuela organized a public event on June 13 to discuss the 50th Anniversary of the Cuban Revolution and the lessons for Latin America. Over 60 people attended the event, which was held at the United Labor Centre in Minneapolis, and nearly $100 in donations were raised to help develop the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The event featured two main speakers, Jorge Martín, International Secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign and regular presenter at the Havana Book Fair in Cuba, and August Nimtz, a professor at the University of Minnesota and member of the Minnesota Cuba Committee. The discussion was facilitated by Sonia Arevalo of the MN FMLN rank and file committee ""Combatiente Anonimo."" Professor Nimtz opened the meeting by raising the issue of the continued political attacks of the US courts against the Cuban Five. He went on to address the history of the aggressive policies the US and other imperialist nations have carried out against Cuba. In speaking about the history of the revolution, he also emphasized the inheritance of an underdeveloped nation by the Cuban masses. The Cuban revolution has to be analysed not in isolation but as part of the process of world revolution, he said, and therefore, the best way to help it is to advance revolution in our own countries. Jorge Martin, who spoke nearly a year ago in the same hall at an event about the Venezuelan Revolution , drew out the important point that the two revolutions are intimately linked and that in the final analysis, the only real guarantee for the survival of the Cuban Revolution is the victory of the world socialist revolution. Jorge contrasted the euphoria of the capitalists at the fall of the USSR, and recent propaganda campaigns claiming that the Cuban Revolution was in vain, against the basic facts and figures resulting from the the expropriation of capitalism on the island. For example, there has been an 15-year increase in life expectancy since the 1959 revolution, bringing the average up from 62 years to 77.7 years. This is a figure comparable to the advanced capitalists nations (including the US, where it is also 77.9), but which in the Caribbean stands far above all others, for example in Haiti where 59 years is the average life expectancy today. He quoted an early achievement of the revolution, the expansion of those who are literate to 99.8 percent. Again, compare this to capitalist nations in the region, such as Brazil, with a significantly larger economy ,yet with still only a 86 percent literacy rate. He also pointed out at the statistics for infant mortality where Cuba scores better than even the US itself, as well as the fact that in Cuba there is free health care for all, not to mention free education at all levels. Jorge also showed that when Cuba was forced to abandon its sugar production, rather than abandon its workers to unemployment and poverty, all the workers received free higher education to learn new skills and guaranteed employment. By looking at these gains, balanced against the conditions the masses face in capitalists countries, it was pointed out that the revolution was indeed very much worth it! Fifty years since the Cuban revolution, there is reason to celebrate and also reason to learn from it, particularly the fact that only by abolishing capitalism can the problems of the masses begin to be addressed. This is a clear lesson for the Venezuelan revolution, Jorge stressed. Returning to his initial point, Jorge showed how in 2003 - 2004 a life line was extended to Cuba by way of the opening up of the Venezuelan Revolution, which at that time managed to get control over the state-owned oil company PDVSA. Cuba, with its nationalized health care system, provides 20,000 doctors and nurses to Venezuela, usually to the poorest areas treating people who had previously never been seen by a health care provider. In exchange, Venezuela provides Cuba with oil. He re-emphasized that internationalism is crucial to defending and extending both revolutions. He also explained that Cuba still faces many economic problems, as the price of nickel, Cuba's main export, has collapsed and is 60 percent lower this year than it had been for years, resulting in a forecast loss of $1 billion of income for 2009. In addition, Venezuela's economy has been hit by the drop in the price of oil over the last period. Several tropical storms have also battered Cuba, resulting in tremendous amounts of damage. However, as Jorge pointed out, the human cost of the storms were low - compared to many Caribbean nations, or as he explained, even in the Gulf Coast region in the US, due to the government's efforts to protect and move every citizen, appliance, and even livestock to safety. Jorge also referred to the speech made by Fidel Castro to the youth of Cuba in November 2005 which explained that the main danger facing the revolution was not a external military threat, as that threat has been insulated against by the gains of the revolution. Rather, the main threats come from within: bureaucracy, corruption, the new rich. Jorge said this perspective was correct, but that there is optimism for the revolution, as there is a healthy debate in Cuba as how to maintain the gains of the revolution, particularly as the Latin American revolution advances at the same time as the crisis of capitalism deepens. Jorge refered to a discussion held during the 2008 Havana Book Fair where Communist writers and intellectuals explained that there is no interest in returning to the period known as the ""five grey years"" (1971-1976) when there was Stalinist censorship in the field of arts and culture. Cuban writer Desiderio Navarro made it clear that Stalinism in the end leads to capitalist restoration and that in order to defend socialism one had to opposed both Stalinism and the ""Chinese way"" since both ended up in capitalism. Both August and Jorge made the point in closing their presentations that the best way to defend the Cuban Revolution is to begin to prepare the forces of revolution in our own countries. We are happy to say that many of those who attended the event left contact info in order to get involved in future events. The past 50 years has provided the working class with many lessons. The Cuban Revolution continues to serve as a positive example of what is possible when capitalism is done away with and the foundations of socialism are established! ",NA,NA

The meeting was held at the popular Norwich Playhouse and was attended by 20 people. The purpose of the meeting was to engage people in a discussion about worker’s control, which is the essence of the Venezuelan revolution. Hands Off Venezuela has enjoyed a lot of support and sympathy while it has been active in Norwich, but has so far concentrated on political questions, such as whether socialism can be achieved through reformism or revolution. The two films take the Venezuelan revolution to the level of most people’s daily experience: the workplace. They demonstrate how factory occupations are not a phenomenon confined to South America. The recent experience at Visteon and Lindsey before that have shown that militancy pays. These actions were taken in spite of a right wing trade union leadership that advised its worker’s that the occupation was illegal and that they should leave the premises or face the police. The level of discussion was very good and raised some very good points. It was pointed out that the experience in Britain had a defensive nature, compared to the Venezuelan example whereby a factory closed is a factory occupied. In Venezuela, the demands go beyond the basic rights of workers and start to question who exactly runs the factories. A debate ensued over why this could be, and it was suggested that occupations in Venezuela were at a much higher stage because workers in Venezuela have had to face organised scarcity, whereby bosses effectively leave their factories standing idle. For example, milk production in Venezuela has been completely sabotaged by the oligarchy. These conditions of scarcity have forced workers to take over the running of the factories themselves, producing for need rather than for profit, as best seen in the valve producing plant Inveval. The role of the union during the Visteon dispute was also discussed, where we all agreed that the unions in Britain are too conciliatory, and must change in the coming period if worker’s are to effectively fight against attacks on their working conditions. The meeting was great success and puts Hands Off Venezuela in a strong position for next year. It has already been suggested by a number of people that the films are shown at the University of East Anglia. The experience in Venezuela is a striking lesson for worker’s in Britain who can follow its examples when they come under attack from their bosses.",NA,NA

			From Caracas to Montreal: Another World Is Possible",2009-06-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Emerson da Silva and Nichola Richer"," French version below. On Thursday, the 4 th of June, the Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands off Venezuela held a public conference on the subject “From Caracas to Montreal: Another World Is Possible.” A little over a hundred people came to listen to, and debate with, panelists Jorge Martin, international secretary of the Hands off Venezuela campaign and member of the International Marxist Tendency, and Guillaume Hébert, coordinator of the alter-globalization commission of Québec solidaire, a young party founded to unite the left-wing movements in Quebec. The discussion centered on how the left in Quebec can learn from the Bolivarian revolution led by Hugo Chávez. Martin began his comments with a brief reminder of history. Twenty years ago, with the fall of the Berlin wall, joyful right-wing ideologues and the global bourgeois class were hastily declaring the “fall of socialism.” In the same year, another major event took place, although almost nobody paid much attention in the mist of the celebration of the supposed victory of capitalism. This was the popular uprising against Venezuelan structural adjustment measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund, an event known as the “Caracazo.” This popular revolt called into question the very basis of capitalism: private property. The reaction of the Venezuelan bourgeoisie, with the tireless support of almost all major media in the world, was swift and cruel. Several thousand people lost their lives in the brutal repression that followed the rebellion. However, for some analysts of Latin America, it was 1989 that marks the start of the Bolivarian Revolution. Martin emphasized the salient features of these events, namely, the direct participation of the people decided to take control over their own destiny. The arrival of Hugo Chávez to the presidency in 1998 and fit into the chronology of the revolution as a logical continuation of the “Caracazo,” which is more accurately known as the “Sacudón” (the great shaking) because the population took to the streets not only in Caracas, but throughout the country. This revolution has been threatened repeatedly, Martin reminded the audience, including during the coup d'état in April 2002 and the sabotage of the oil industry in 2002/2003, but every time it was saved by the direct intervention of revolutionary workers. The occupation of factories and operation of production under worker control are clearly a step toward overcoming capitalism and building socialism, said Martin, for whom this means reconnecting with long-established traditions of workers around the world The testimony of Paul-André Boucher, leader of the factory occupation in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec, in 1972, came to corroborate this assertion. The audience paid a moving tribute to the former labour leader. For Guillaume Hébert, the influence of emancipation struggles in Latin America has been felt in Quebec since at least the Patriots’ War, which was largely inspired by the liberation movement of Simon Bolivar and his followers. The Québec solidaire coordinator also said that Quebec in many respects deserves to be called Latin America North, having in common not only cultural influences, but also a history of colonial oppression characterized by the systematic looting of its natural resources. More recently, according to Hébert, the struggle of the FLQ was also influenced by South American revolutionaries, including the Uruguayan Tupamaros movement, without forgetting, of course, the mark of the Cuban Revolution on the hearts and minds of all generations of activists since 1959. The audience was not indifferent to the words of panelists. Many people enriched the discussions with comments and questions whose answers ultimately cannot be found in the framework of a symposium, but only through the emancipatory struggles in Quebec and across Canada. We also wish to thank the following organizations for their support: the Public Service Alliance of Canada-Quebec (PSAC-Quebec), QPIRG-McGill, and the AÉÉDEM (Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill). {mosframe http://www.flickr.com/photos/lariposte/sets/72157619311962452/show/,100%,450} In French Le jeudi 4 juin dernier, à la salle DSR-510, de l'Université du Québec à Montréal, s'est tenue la conférence De Caracas à Montréal, un autre monde est possible, organisée par la Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands off Venezuela . Un peu plus d'une centaine de personnes s'y sont rendues pour écouter et débattre avec les conférenciers Jorge Martin, secrétaire international de la campagne Hands Off Venezuela et membre de la Tendance Marxiste Internationale, et Guillaume Hébert, coordinateur de la commission altermondialiste de Québec Solidaire, ce jeune parti qui rassemble les forces de gauche de la nation québécoise. Le fil conducteur de toutes les interventions: les forces de gauche au Québec peuvent-elles s'inspirer de la Révolution bolivarienne commandée par le président Hugo Chávez? Jorge Martin a commencé son intervention par un bref rappel historique. Il y a 20 ans, la chute du mur de Berlin, que certains ont trop hâtivement appelée ""la chute du socialisme "", emplissait de joie les idéologues de droite et les classes bourgeoises du monde entier. À la même année, un événement majeur avait eu lieu, bien que presque personne n'y fit grand attention au milieu du vacarme de la grande fête de la supposée victoire finale du capitalisme. Ce fut le soulèvement populaire vénézuélien contre les mesures d'ajustement structurel imposées par le Fonds monétaire international connu sous le nom de « Caracazo ». Cette révolte populaire a remis en cause le fondement même du système capitaliste : la propriété privée. La réaction de la bourgeoisie vénézuélienne, avec le soutien acharné de presque tous les grands médias du monde, fut des plus cruelle. Plusieurs milliers de personnes ont perdu la vie dans la brutale répression qui a suivi la rébellion du peuple. Néanmoins, pour certains analystes de la scène latino-américaine, c'est à partir de 1989 qu'il faut compter la Révolution bolivarienne. Jorge Martin a insisté sur la caractéristique majeure de tous ces événements, à savoir, la participation directe d'un peuple décidé à prendre en mains son propre destin. L'arrivée de Hugo Chávez à la présidence de la République en 1998 s'inscrit ainsi dans la chronologie révolutionnaire comme une suite logique du « Caracazo », aussi connue sous l'appellation plus juste de « Sacudón » (le grand secouement), car la population avait pris la rue non seulement à Caracas, la capitale, mais dans l'ensemble du pays. Cette Révolution en cours aura été maintes fois menacées, notamment lors du coup d'État d'avril 2002 et du sabotage pétrolier de 2002/2003, a rappelé encore Jorge Martin, mais à chaque fois elle a été sauvée par l'intervention directe des travailleuses et des travailleurs révolutionnaires. L'occupation d'usines et la remise en marche des unités de production sous contrôle ouvrier vont clairement dans le sens du dépassement du capitalisme par la voie du socialisme, a dit Martin, pour qui cela constitue un renouement avec d'anciennes traditions ouvrières d'un peu partout au monde. Le témoignage de monsieur Paul-André Boucher, dirigeant de l'occupation d'usine à Saint-Jérôme, Québec, en 1972, est venu corroborer cette affirmation. Le public présent a rendu un émouvant hommage à l'ancien dirigeant ouvrier québécois en lui adressant de chaleureux applaudissements. Pour Guillaume Hébert, l'influence des luttes d'émancipation latino-américaines se fait sentir au Québec au moins depuis la Révolution des Patriotes, largement inspirés des gestes libérateurs de Simon Bolivar et ses suiveurs. Le dirigeant de Québec solidaire a affirmé en outre que le Québec mérite à bien des égards de se faire appeler l'Amérique latine du Nord, ayant en commun avec le continent sud-américain des influences culturelles, mais aussi le fait de subir une oppression coloniale caractérisée par le pillage systématique de ses ressources naturelles. Plus près de nous dans le temps, selon Guillaume Hébert, le combat du FLQ a lui aussi été influencé par les révolutionnaires sud-américains, notamment par le mouvement uruguayen Tupamaros, sans oublier, bien sûr, la marque incontournable dès la Révolution cubaine dans les coeurs et les esprits de toutes les générations de militants depuis 1959. Le public présent n'est pas resté indifférent aux discours des conférenciers. Nombre de personnes ont pris la parole pour enrichir les réflexions avec des commentaires et des questions dont les réponses ne sauraient être trouvées dans le cadre d'un colloque, mais seulement au coeur même des actuels combats émancipateurs du Québec et de l'ensemble du Canada. Nous tenons également à remercier les organisations suivantes pour leur soutien : l’Alliance de la Fonction Publique du Canada-Québec (AFPC-Québec), la GRIPQ-McGill, et L'AÉÉDEM (Association des Étudiants et étudiantes Diplômé(e)s Employé(e)s de McGill).

			Second Latin American Meeting of Worker-Recovered Factories",2009-05-08T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," In Latin America resistance against the destruction of industry and the defense of jobs took on different forms. The criticism and questioning of these are part of the discussion within the labor movement and they were debated at the First Latin American Meeting of Worker-Recovered Factories , which was held in Venezuela on October 29, 2005. At that time we said: ""They close factories, we open them. They steal the land and we occupy it. They wage wars and destroy nations; we defend peace and the sovereign integration of the peoples. They divide and we unite. Because we are the working class. Because we are the present and the future of the humanity"". Today, even more than in 2005, the situation of the people of Latin America strengthens our resolve to continue building and deepening this unity. The current situation on our continent did not come to us as a free gift. It has taken many years of uprisings, resistance, projects and a lot of hard work on the part of workers to build this historical opportunity. Our movement is anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist. It is a call and an organized movement of the working class against the regime of private property of the means of production, which can only survive by waging wars, exploiting and oppressing the people. We are aware that the struggle is at different stages in our American continent, and that many of today's governments do not represent our interests; however, we are witnessing a situation which is favorable for the making of concrete proposals, to debate and to put the stamp of the workers on the matters that concern us. Clearly, this will not be easy. In Bolivia we saw how the ruling class reacted to the nationalization of natural resources, faced with the putting into practice of genuine sovereignty. Or in Venezuela, which with its revolutionary steps forward in the fields of education, healthcare, the land question, continues to be a thorn in the side of those who have always lived on the backs of the people and its resources. And so, they continue to produce lies through their media, using fear and hunger. Despite this, the Venezuelan and Bolivian people were not deceived and reelected Chavez and Evo Morales. The same was the case in Ecuador with Correa and, recently, in Paraguay, with the election of Lugo by the people. We are making an appeal to all the factories recovered by the workers and to the social organizations in struggle to participate in the ""Second Latin American Meeting of Worker-Recovered Factories"", and unite the struggle of our sector with that of the rest of the working class and support the struggle for socialism that is being carried out by the Bolivian and Venezuelan people with the support of the workers of the whole of Latin America. We appeal to all of you to join our efforts and to meet in Caracas, Venezuela on June 25, 26 and 27, 2009. Long live the struggle of the workers in the recovered factories! Long live the struggle of the working class! Long live the Venezuelan revolution! Long live the Bolivian revolution! We will win! Venceremos!

Latin Amerika İşgal Fabrikaları Toplantısı’nın da gündemiydiler. Şunu söylüyoruz: “Onlar fabrikaları kapatıyorlar, bizlerse açıyoruz.Onlar toprağı çalıyorlar, bizse işliyoruz.Onlar savaş çıkarıyor ve halkları katlediyorlar; bizlerse barışı ve halkların bağımsız birliğini savunuyoruz.Onlar bölüyorlar, biz birleştiriyoruz.Çünkü biz, işçi sınıfıyız.Çünkü biz, insanlığın bugünü ve geleceğiyiz.” Bugün Latin Amerika halklarının durumu, 2005’te olduğundan daha fazla, bu birliği inşa etmek ve derinleştirmek gerekliliğinin önemini gösteriyor bize.Kıtamızda halklar arasındaki ilişkilerin mevcut siyasi durumu, henüz bunu karşılamaktan uzak.Bu tarihsel fırsatı inşa etmek üzere işçiler yıllardır direniyor, proje üretiyor ve çalışıyorlar.Hareketimiz antiemperyalist ve antikapitalisttir.Büyük üretim araçları mülkiyeti rejimine karşı, savaşları ve halkların ezilmesini engelleyebilecek tek yol olan, işçi sınıfının çığlığı ve örgütlü bir hareketidir.Biliyoruz ki Amerika’mızda her zaman gölgeler oldu ve mevcut birçok hükümet çıkarlarımızı temsil etmiyor, ancak öneriler geliştirmek, tartışmak ve sorunlara işçi sınıfının çözümünü getirmek için olumlu bir durum söz konusu.Bunun kolay olmadığı açık. Bolivya’da, kaynakların kamulaştırılmasına ve halk egemenliğin kullanılmasına karşı çıkan hâkim sınıflardan bunu görebiliyoruz.Venezüella’da eğitimde, sağlıkta, tarlada süren devrimci ilerleme, yıllardır halka rağmen ve onun kaynakları pahasına yaşamış olanları rahatsız etmeyi sürdürüyor.Korku ve açlık üzerinden yalanlar üretmeye devam ediyorlar.Tüm bunlara rağmen Venezüella halkı Bolivya halkını aldatmadı ve Chavez’i ve Ebediyeti yeniden seçti.Ekvador’da Correa’da ve yakın zamanda Paraguay’da halk için Lugo’nun seçilmesinde olduğu gibi. İşçileri tarafından kurtarılan tüm fabrikaları ve sosyal örgütleri “2. Latin Amerika İşgal Fabrikaları Toplantısı” için mücadeleye, işçi sınıfı adına sektörümüzün mücadelesine katılmaya ve tüm Latin Amerika işçileri tarafından desteklenen Bolivya ve Venezüella halkı tarafından gerçekleştirilen sosyalizm için mücadeleye çağırıyoruz. Çabalarımıza el vermek üzere Venezüella Caracas’ta 25, 26 ve 27 Haziran 2009 tarihinde gerçekleştirilecek toplantıya çağırıyoruz. Yaşasın işgal fabrikaları işçilerinin mücadelesi! Yaşasın işçi sınıfı mücadelesi! Yaşasın Venezüella devrimi! Yaşasın Bolivya devrimi! Biz kazanacağız! İletişim: This email address is being protected from spambots.

													Kinga Kalocsai in Budapest"," The Hungarian-Venezuelan Solidarity Association held a Venezuelan Festival in Budapest, Hungary, in the middle of April on the occasion of the anniversary of the defeat of the anti-Chavez coup in Venezuela in 2002. This was a three day festival especially for youth but also open to all age groups. The programme was very colourful. There were presentations of a lot of films about Venezuela, including People and Struggle in the 4 th World War, No Volverán, Venezuela Rising, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised and many more. There were two book presentations in Hungarian, one book about Simon Bolivar and one by the famous Venezuelan poet, Victor Valera Mora. There was also a children's programme and every night there were various music groups, some of them Venezuelans who live in Hungary and some Hungarians who support the process in Venezuela.

													FRETECO"," An appeal by Freteco to public opinion and the workers of the world It is now four years since the nationalisation of the Inveval valve in Venezuela. Since then, the workers of Inveval have been running the factory under workers' control, showing the way forward for the building of socialism in Venezuela. After the expropriation of the company in 2005 by president Chávez, they set up a democratically elected, accountable and recallable factory council to coordinate production, organised a trade union in order to link up with the rest of the labour movement, and built links with the communal councils in the state of Miranda, where they are based. They also organised the Revolutionary Front of Occupied Factories (Freteco) together with the workers of other companies occupied or nationalised (INAF, Gotcha, MDS, Vivex, SIDOR and others). The workers of Inveval have shown that workers can successfully run a factory. For the last 4 years they have kept the company going by repairing broken valves, and have prepared it for the production of new valves. However, they have not been able to produce new valves because of the constant hurdles put in their way by the state functionaries, who are acting directly against the decisions of president Chavez. The state bureaucracy does not want workers' control in Inveval to be successful for very simple reason: they do not want it to become an example to workers in other companies. A socialist company should be part of a democratic plan coordinated with the other state-owned companies, including having its own budget covering raw materials, financing, etc. But the state bureaucracy is working to suffocate Inveval economically. They are refusing to give the factory a budget for 2009, on top of the fact that Inveval's budget for 2008 has still not been transferred to the company. The workers of Inveval have not been given any reason for this. This means, de facto , leaving Inveval in bankruptcy. Additionally, in 2008, president Chavez gave the order to expropriate Acerven in Tinaquillo, Cojedes, a company that makes the casts which would allow Inveval to go from simply repairing valves to manufacturing new valves for the oil industry. To this day, Chavez's order has not been implemented. Meanwhile, the oil industry is importing valves. This is a lucrative business for some people who are putting pressure on the state functionaries so that Inveval is not allow to manufacture new valves. This whole situation of inefficiency and outright bureaucratic sabotage has created enormous stress for the workers of Inveval. Four years after the expropriation, functionaries of PDVSA and the Ministry of Light Industries (Milco) continue to prevent the orders of president Chavez, which would allow Inveval to work to full capacity, from being implemented. After the expropriations of Invepal and Inveval, the workers of the Gotcha textile factory, of the bathroom fittings company INAF, and the transport company MDS, also occupied their factories, in response to attacks from the bosses, the lack of payment of social security contributions, and the abandonment of production. The workers of these companies have made repeated appeals for these companies to be expropriated, but so far they have received no answer from the ministry in charge, Milco. There are some 150 workers who have been resisting for the last 3 or 4 years in very difficult conditions. Finally, there is the case of Vivex, an auto parts company in the state of Anzoategui. In November 2008, the workers were faced with the refusal of the boss to pay the full benefits pay to which they were entitled. Responding to the appeal by president Chavez, who said that the workers in companies where the bosses were denying them their rights should occupy them, more than 300 Vivex workers took over the plant. They have been in occupation for 6 months without receiving any wages, and without receiving any response to their appeals to functionaries of the Presidency who are dealing with their case. There is an urgent need to demand the expropriation of these companies to safeguard the jobs and source of income for hundreds of families. The workers of Toyota, a car company in Cumaná, in the state of Sucre, have been in struggle in defence of their collective bargaining rights and in solidarity with the struggle of Mitsubushi workers in Anzoategui. As part of their struggle, on March 6, 2009, they decided to occupy the installations of the company, an occupation which they maintained for several weeks. On Tuesday, May 5, the general secretary of the union of Toyota workers (Sintratoyota), Argenis Vazquez, was assassinated when he was on his way to a meeting with management. This is a new case of assassination of militant trade union leaders in Venezuela, after the assassination of the 3 UNT trade union leaders in Aragua in November 2008, and the killing of two Mitsubishi and Macusa workers at the hands of the police in Anzoategui in January 2009 (an attack which was directed against Felix Martínez, the general secretary of the Mitsubishi workers' union Singetram). We demand a full inquiry into this assassination and that those responsible be brought to justice. For all of these reasons we make an appeal to the Venezuelan people, the international working class and all those who support the struggle of the workers for their emancipation to send messages to president Chavez asking for: Knowing of the problems faced by the workers in the occupied factories in Venezuela, we ask you for a quick solution to their problems in the following terms: 1) The expropriation of Acerven under workers' control 2) Do not leave Inveval at the mercy of the capitalist market. For a 2008 and 2009 budget for the company, as part of a plan of production with PDVSA and the Ministry of Science and Technology. 3) An end to the bureaucratic sabotage against Inveval - State bodies should implement the orders of president Chávez 4) The expropriation of Gotcha, INAF, MDS and Vivex - for the defence of jobs and livelihoods of hundreds of families. 5) Stop the killings of trade union activists - Full inquiry into the killing of Argenis Vazquez, general secretary of Sintratoyota - those responsible should be brought to justice, both those who carried out the killing and those who ordered it.

Los trabajadores de Inveval llevan 4 años de control obrero en la fábrica mostrando el camino para la construcción del socialismo en Venezuela . Tras su expropiación en 2005 por el presidente Chávez formaron un consejo de fábrica para dirigir la misma, crearon un sindicato para vincularse con el resto de la clase trabajadora y mantuvieron un contacto con los consejos comunales del estado Miranda. También se vincularon a los trabajadores de otras fabricas ocupadas o nacionalizadas INAF, Gotcha, MDS, Vivex, Sidor, a través del la creación bajo su iniciativa de FRETECO (Frente Revolucionario de trabajadores de empresas en cogestion y ocupadas). Los trabajadores de INVEVAL han demostrando que los trabajadores si pueden dirigir exitosamente una fabrica. Esto 4 años los trabajadores recuperaron la fábrica exitosamente preparándola para poder producir. En este tiempo los trabajadores han estado reparando válvulas. Sin embargo la fábrica no ha podido ponerse a producir debido a las continuas trabas que se ha puesto al funcionamiento de la misma por parte de entes del estado contraviniendo las órdenes emanadas por el Presidente de la República, Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías. La burocracia del estado no quiere que el control obrero en Inveval sea un éxito, para que no se convierta en un ejemplo para trabajadores en otras empresas. Esto ha llevado a tratar de ahogar INVEVAL económicamente dejándola sin presupuesto para el 2009. El presupuesto de la empresa para el 2008 todavía no se ha entregado. Los trabajadores de INVEVAL desconocen la causa de ellos. Esto en la práctica supone dejar a INVEVAL en la quiebra. Una empresa socialista debe estar dentro del marco de la planificación económica coordinada con otras empresas del estado conforme a unos objetivos, que cubra insumo, financiación, materia prima, etc. Al mismo tiempo del presidente Chávez en 2008 dio la orden de expropiar la empresa Acerven situada en Tinaquillo estado Cojedes empresa clave y que produce los moldes de las válvulas para que INVEVAL pase de reparar válvulas a producir para la industria petrolera. Hasta el día de hoy no se ha expropiado la empresa pese a que el Presidente Chávez la aprobó. Mientras tanto se están importando válvulas para la industria petrolera. Esto supone un negocio para algunos, que presionan dentro de los organismos del estado para que INVEVAL no se ponga a funcionar plenamente y pueda surtir con valvulas fabricadas en Venezuela las necesidades de la industria petrolera. Toda esta situación de ineficacia y sabotaje burocrático ha provocado enormes tensiones e incertidumbre entre los trabajadores de INVEVAL. 4 años después de la expropiación, los funcionarios tanto de PDVSA como del MILCO siguen incumpliendo los mandatos del presidente Chávez respecto a Inveval y que permitirían la puesta en funcionamiento pleno de la fábrica. Posteriormente a las expropiaciones de Invepal e Inveval, los trabajadores de la empresa textil Gotcha, de la empresa de complementos de grifería INAF y de la de transporte MDS también ocuparon sus empresas, como resultado de los ataques de los patronos, el impago de la seguridad social y el abandono de la producción por parte de los empresarios. Los trabajadores de estas empresas han hecho repetidos llamamientos a que estas empresas sean expropiadas, pero no ha habido ninguna respuesta por parte del ministerio responsable Milco. Unos 150 trabajadores llevan entre 3 y 4 años resistiendo en condiciones muy difíciles. Finalmente está el caso de Vivex, empresa autopartista en Anzoatugui, los trabajadores se enfrentaron en Noviembre del 2008 a la negativa del patrón de pagar las utilidades (paga de beneficios) que les correspondía. Ante el llamado del presidente Chávez a que los trabajadores en empresas dónde los patronos atropellaran sus derechos o tuvieran problemas de impago de salarios y beneficios a que las tomaran, los más de 300 trabajadores de Vivex decidieron tomarla. Llevan ya 6 meses de ocupación sin cobrar ningún salario y sin recibir ninguna respuesta a sus gestiones ante funcionarios de la Presidencia de la República. Es urgente exigir la nacionalización de estas empresas para garantizar los puestos de trabajo y la fuente de ingresos de cientos de familias. Los trabajadores de Toyota, empresa automotriz en Cumaná, Sucre, llevan meses de lucha en defensa de la contratación colectiva y en solidaridad con la lucha de los trabajadores de Mitsubishi en Anzoategui. Como parte de esa lucha, el 6 de marzo decicidieron tomar las instalaciones de la empresa, toma que se prolongó durante varias semanas. El martes 5 de mayo, el secretario general del sindicato de trabajadores de Toyota (Sintratoyota), Argenis Vazquez, fue asesinado cuando se dirigía a una reunión con la empresa. Este es un nuevo caso de asesinato contra dirigentes sindicales combativos en Venezuela, después del asesinato de los tres dirigentes de la UNT de Aragua en noviembre del 2008, y la muerte de dos trabajadores de Mitsubishi y Macusa a manos de la policia en Anzoategui en ener del 2009 (un ataque que iba dirigido contra Felix Martínzez, el dirigente del sindicato de Mitsubishi SINGETRAM). Exigimos la investigación de este asesinato y que los responsables materiales e intelectuales sean castigados. Por todos estos motivos ello hacemos un llamado al pueblo venezolano, a la clase obrera internacional y a toda persona progresista que está a favor de la lucha de los trabajadores por su emancipación a que envié mensajes al Presidente Chávez en los siguientes términos. Ante los problemas a los que se enfrentan los trabajadores de las empresas ocupadas en Venezuela, los abajo firmantes se dirigen a usted con el fin de solicitarle su rápida solución en los siguientes términos: 1)Expropiación de Acerven y puesta en funcionamiento bajo control de los trabajadores 2) No a dejar a INVEVAL a merced del mercado capitalista. Por un presupuesto para 2008 y 2009 en el marco de una planificación con PDVSA y el ministerio de ciencia y tecnología de la producción anual de la planta. 3)Basta de sabotaje burocrático contra INVEVAL. Que los entes del estado cumplan las órdenes del Presidente Chávez. 4) Expropiación de Gotcha, INAF, MDS y Vivex - por la defensa del empleo y las fuentes de ingreso de cientos de familias 5) Basta de asesinatos de sindicalistas - Investigación a fondo y castigo para los responsables materiales e intelectuales del asesinato de Argenis Vazquez, secretario general de SIntratoyota.

			Occupy! Public Meeting in London",2009-05-15T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Will Roche"," Hands Off Venezuela Britain organized a meeting last Wednesday night in an effort to inform and inspire the British labour movement about one of the most exciting aspects of the Venezuelan revolution, the factory occupation movement. But unlike other meetings, this event attempted for the first to time to tie together the movement in Venezuela with the recent wave of factory occupations here in Britain. Around 60 people gathered at Bolivar Hall in London to watch films and listen to speakers. The event began on the subject of Venezuela, with the screening of a new documentary by ViveTV called ‘FRETECO' (Revolutionary Front of Workers in Occupied and Worker-run Factories). The film focuses on how this Venezuelan organization, made up of representatives from over 20 factories, is trying to help workers' control to develop and spread by building links between the different factories in struggle in order to learn from each other’s experiences, and to coordinate the movement on a national level. So far FRETECO is working in the oil, ceramics, steel, aluminium, food, fittings, textiles, and the car industries. After the film, Henry Suarez, from the Venezuelan Embassy, gave us the background to the Venezuelan revolution, and also described how economic development is changing the demographics of the country, shifting from a rural based population towards an urban based population. He mentioned that the industrial working class has become an increasingly significant factor in the revolution. Francesco Merli, from Hands Off Venezuela, made the important point that it is the workers themselves who are discussing and planning their own course of action based on their own experiences, and that the fight by these workers for the democratic control and planning of their workplaces is one of the most important parts of the Venezuelan revolution, showing the way forward in the building of socialism in Venezuela. Despite the gains of the movement, Francesco highlighted that in many cases the movement continues to face hostilities from bosses, who often hire thugs to intimidate, or even assassinate workers and trade unionists. There is also the ongoing opposition from the 'Bolivarian bureaucracy' which is seeking to undermine socialism, and restore capitalist relations. They are achieving this by blocking contracts and raw materials to the occupied factories. The topics discussed were made all the more relevant, as the audience welcomed to the stage three British workers who recently captured the nation's attention by occupying their Visteon car parts factory in Enfield, north London. They described how hundreds of workers were made redundant with only 6 minutes notice with no pay, despite having made huge profits for the management for decades. Ray Dixon explained that the system has failed us, and that the law doesn't recognize the rights of working people. He called for change, and reinforced the point that by not acting we become part of the problem. The final speaker was Alberto Einstein Durango from the Latin American community in London. He told us about the work he has been doing in solidarity with the cleaners who were unfairly sacked by the company Mitie. He also revealed his recent victimization for being a trade union activist. A petition was handed around for their campaign. A packed agenda left little time for discussion unfortunately, but one member of the audience asked whether the Visteon workers think they could have put the factory into production without the management, to which they replied ""Yes! definitely!""

			Successful screening of “No Volveran” in Copenhagen",2009-04-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands off Venezuela Denmark"," This April marks the 7th anniversary of the coup in Venezuela. The coup was organised by the oligarchy in Venezuela with the aid of US Imperialism. But the triumph of the reactionaries was short. Less than 36 hours after the beginning of the coup, it collapsed. The masses spontaneously took to the streets to defend the democratically elected president and government. This episode marks a very important point in the Venezuelan revolution. The masses took the role as the main actors of the revolution. To commemorate this, the Venezuelan embassy in Copenhagen invited to a commemoration event on April 17 to show the film ""No Volveran"". 40 people attended the meeting and the screening of the film. ""No Volveran"" was produced by activists of the Hands off Venezuela campaign and it has been shown to thousands of youth and workers across the world. It has also been screened on national television in Venezuela recently. The charge d'affaires of Venezuela, Dr. Roger Corbacho, welcomed the guests. He stressed the need to discuss the processes in the Venezuelan revolution. He highlighted the film as a good documentation of the living processes in the revolution. He said that he might not agree with all points made in the film, but that the main thing is to continue and broaden the discussion on how to advance the revolution. Representatives from the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Denmark were invited to introduce the film. Rasmus Jensen, national coordinator of the campaign, said that it is very important to discuss the revolution for several reasons. One reason is that the masses of Venezuela are facing decisive actions and turning points in order to complete the revolution. Another reason is the inspiration the revolution gives to workers and youth in the rest of the world. He said that only by spreading the ideas of the revolution it can be defended. That is to say, the best way to defend the Venezuelan revolution in Denmark is to win people to revolutionary ideas and fight for socialism. Rasmus Jensen explained that the film shows what a revolution is in practice. A revolution, he said, is when the majority moves in a decisive manner to transform society; when they take destiny into their own hands and become conscious of their own role in society. But the film also shows that the revolution has not won decisively yet. The revolution has made big steps in the right direction, but there are still many unsolved problems and challenges. The bulk of the economy is still in private hands, and the capitalists use their power to sabotage the revolution. As long as the economy is not controlled by the masses of Venezuela, none of the gains made so far is secure. The film was well received by the 40 guests, among whom were the ambassadors of Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua. Also, activists from the Hands off Venezuela campaign and the Danish-Cuban Friendship Association were present. Several of the guests had comments and questions about the film and the situation in Venezuela. Charge d'affaires Dr. Roger Corbacho led the debate and expressed his view of the situation in Venezuela. He is very interested in the situation of the occupied factories and he said that the struggles of these factories cannot remain isolated. The ambassador of Bolivia praised the film and found it very inspiring. He said that although the conditions in Bolivia are different than in Venezuela (for instance Bolivia is poorer and has inherited generations of oppression of the indigenous people), the workers' struggle to change society - as pictured by the film - bears relevance across borders. The Hands off Venezuela Campaign would like to send warmly thanks to charge d'affaires Dr. Roger Corbacho and the staff at the Venezuelan embassy in Copenhagen for arranging such a splendid meeting and a good debate. We look forward to working together in the future. We hope that more arrangements like this will be held in the future to discuss the tasks of the revolution, strengthen the solidarity work in Denmark, and spread the revolutionary ideas among the Danish workers and youth.

			Historic meeting as Toronto HOV merges with Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel”",2009-04-23T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Camilo Cahis and Jennie Ernewein"," 60 people gathered in Toronto on 18 th April 2009 to celebrate the merger of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and the Bolivarian Circle “Louis Riel” (CBLR). The event hosted a discussion about the current economic crisis and how the Venezuelan Revolution is providing an alternative. This was a historic meeting that was attended by Mirna Quero de Peña, the Venezuelan consul-general in Toronto, as well as by a number of Quebec activists representing HOV/Bolivarian Society of Quebec (SBQ). The union between HOV and the Bolivarian Circle came after years of close work and collaboration by the two groups. Considering the close political activity and agreement between us, it only seemed natural to unite the work and strengthen the Venezuela solidarity movement in Toronto. The meeting began with warm greetings from the office of the Consul-General of Venezuela. José Antonio Rodríguez de la Sierra, Attaché in charge of the Venezuelan embassy, also sent a message, ""A thousand congratulations for such a fortunate and solidarity idea of unifying forces, congratulations which I extend to both organizations wishing you many more successes!” He added later, “You have given a great example to other groups who often fall into divisions and personalized rifts."" Greetings were also sent in by representatives of the Somalian community in Toronto, who have been paying attention to the Venezuelan Revolution with great interest. In addition there were many greetings from Venezuela We Are With You, the Latin American Network, the Toronto Forum on Cuba, Barrio Nuevo Canada, amongst others. Alex Grant spoke first about the failure of capitalism in the recent period and how people in Canada can learn and become inspired by the revolutionary movement in Venezuela and Latin America. Maria Paez Victor then described the gains of the Venezuelan Revolution and how Venezuela has been able to mostly escape the economic crisis that has gripped the entire capitalist world. Finally, Ricardo Astudillo of HOV/SBQ recounted the history of the SBQ and its merger with the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Montreal last October. HOV/SBQ has been successful with building cultural and political links with youth, students and Indigenous communities from Canada and Latin America. The union between HOV and the Bolivarian Circle and SBQ in Toronto and Montreal, respectively, will only serve to strengthen the links that are being built between Venezuelan and Canadian activists and trade unionists. In the present period of economic crisis, there have been recent accounts of workers occupying their factories from Caracas, Chicago and even in Windsor. The lessons of Latin America could have a great affect on the workers’ movement in Canada and provide a valuable set of tools for workers looking to fight back and win. {mosframe http://www.flickr.com/photos/lariposte/sets/72157617059509753/show/,100%,450} Par Camilo Cahis et Jennie Ernewein Le 18 avril 2009, 60 personnes se sont réunies à Toronto, pour célébrer la fusion de la campagne Hands Off Venezuela (HOV) avec le Cercle Bolivarien ""Louis Riel"" (CBLR). L'événement a fourni l'occasion d'un débat sur la crise économique actuelle et la manière dont la Révolution vénézuélienne fournit une alternative. Ce fut une rencontre historique, à laquelle ont assisté la Consule générale de la République Bolivarienne du Venezuela à Toronto, Madame Mirna Quero de Peña, ainsi que certains représentants de HOV Québec / Société bolivarienne du Québec (SBQ). L'union entre HOV et le Cercle Bolivarien ""Louis Riel"" survient après des années de travail et d'étroite collaboration entre les deux groupes. Compte tenu de la proximité des activités politiques des deux organisations et d'un accord mutuel, il semblait naturel ""d'unir le travail et de renforcer le mouvement de solidarité avec le Venezuela"", à Toronto. La réunion a débuté par les chaleureuses salutations du bureau de la Consule générale du Venezuela. José Antonio Rodríguez de la Sierra, Attaché en charge de l'Ambassade de la République Bolivarienne du Venezuela à Ottawa, a également transmis le suivant message: ""Mille félicitations pour cette heureuse idée de solidarité et d'unification des forces - des félicitations que j'adresse aux deux organisations en leur souhaitant beaucoup de succès (...) Vous avez donné un bon exemple à d'autres groupes qui tombent souvent dans des divisions et des déchirements de nature personnelle"". Des salutations ont également été envoyées par des représentants de la Communauté somalienne de Toronto, qui suivent le développement de la Révolution vénézuélienne avec beaucoup d'intérêt. Plusieurs autres messages de félicitations ont été reçus, en provenance de l'organisation Venezuela nous sommes avec toi, le Réseau latino-américain, le Forum torontois sur Cuba, Barrio Nuevo Canada, parmi tant d'autres. Alex Grant de HOV/SBQ a parlé d'abord de l'échec du capitalisme tout récemment et de la façon dont les gens au Canada peuvent apprendre et devenir inspirés par le mouvement révolutionnaire au Venezuela et en Amérique latine. Ensuite Maria Páez Victor a décrit les acquis de la Révolution vénézuélienne et la façon dont le Venezuela a été en mesure d'échapper à la plupart des effets néfastes de la crise économique, qui frappe l'ensemble du monde capitaliste. Pour terminer, Ricardo Astudillo de HOV / SBQ a raconté l'histoire de la SBQ et de sa fusion avec la campagne Hands Off Venezuela en octobre dernier à Montréal. HOV / SBQ a eu du succès dans la construction de liens culturels et politiques entre des jeunes, des étudiants et des communautés autochtones du Canada et de l'Amérique latine. L'union entre HOV et le Cercle bolivarien Louis Riel à Toronto et la SBQ à Montréal, respectivement, permettra de renforcer les liens qui se construisent déjà entre activistes et syndicalistes du Venezuela et du Canada. Au cours de la période actuelle de crise économique, plusieurs travailleurs occupent en effet des usines à Caracas, à Chicago et même à Windsor (Ontario). Les leçons de l'Amérique latine ont une grande influence sur le mouvement des travailleurs au Canada et peuvent fournir un ensemble d'outils précieux pour les travailleurs souhaitant combattre et vaincre. http://www.flickr.com/photos/lariposte/sets/72157617059509753/ ",NA,NA

													HOV Ireland"," On Saturday April 4, the Independent Workers Union made a momentous decision, when the voted to become affiliates of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign in Ireland. Delegates at the IWU national conference in Smyth's of Fairview in Dublin, voted unanimously to endorse the motion by the Cork general branch of the Union to ""Mandate the IWU to affiliate with Hands Off Venezuela"". The vote came after Fran Bowman from the Irish section of HOV, who was an invited guest of the conference, spoke on the political context in Venezuela and gave an overview of the work of HOV. In his speech, Fran outlined the transition during the Chavez Government, from reformism to a more open commitment to establishing a socialist political system in Venezuela. He also cited the aftermath of the coup attempt of 2002 as being a key juncture in the political development of Venezuela, with the elected Government of Venezuela pursuing a more openly socialist line in the post-coup period. Proposing the motion, Donal O' Driscoll of the Cork general branch spoke of the need to show solidarity with the political project in Venezuela. He also outlined the practical implications of affiliation, including the payment of a small affiliation fee, the promotion of HOV events and the appointment of a Liaison officer with HOV. In the aftermath of this unanimous decision, the IWU and HOV are now in the process of formalising the affiliation and promoting fraternal links between the two organisations. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela - Washington DC"," On Thursday, April 16 at 6:30 pm, around 30 people filled the Andres Bello Hall of the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, DC to view the Hands Off Venezuela documentary No Volverán . The crowd included members of the Farabuno Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) of El Salvador, people from Bolivia, Brazil and Venezuela, and many workers from the Venezuelan Embassy itself. The meeting was opened by the Embassy's Charge D'Affaires, Dr. Angelo Rivero Santos, who introduced the Chair of the meeting, comrade Matt Wylie of the DC Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The Chair then introduced the first speaker of the event, Karl Belin of the HOV national board of directors, who is also a member of the local campaign. Karl began by talking about his experiences in Caracas and Los Teques, Venezuela in August of 2005 as part of a US delegation to the 16th World Festival of Youth and Students. He gave his impressions on what he considered the most valuable gains of the Bolivarian Revolution at the time of his visit, the Social Missions. He especially emphasized the gains of the Ribas and Robinson educational missions and shared a story about an old woman who, prior to her learning to do so in the Missions, could not write her name. Karl told the audience that this woman now had an 8th Grade education. Karl then introduced the film about the revolutionary process and the 2006 HOV delegation to Venezuela during the presidential elections. Karl explained that the role of the HOV campaign is not to simply offer moral support, but to participate in the revolutionary wave that is sweeping Latin America, draw lessons from the struggles, and carry them to all 40 countries where HOV is now active. The audience gave an enthusiastic ovation when the film was over. Following the movie, Attaché of Cultural Affairs Patricia Abdelnour encouraged all those in attendance to visit the Embassy regularly for cultural events and art exhibits. She also thanked the HOV campaign once again for their efforts in making the event possible and for their solidarity with the people of Venezuela before giving the floor to Marcos García, Second Secretary of the Labor Attaché. Marcos, a former trade union organizer, gave an enlightening speech on the nationalization of the Inveval and Invepal plants in Venezuela. He also emphasized the role of workers' struggles in the revolutionary process. These, he said, were the most important part of the revolution. The HOV campaign in Washington would like to extend our sincerest thanks to Marcos for his work in obtaining the Andres Bello Hall for the film showing and for making the event possible. Following Marcos' speech, the floor was opened to questions for Marcos and Karl about the film, the revolution, the Embassy, or whatever questions the audience wished to ask. A very fruitful discussion ensued, and people expressed great enthusiasm for the HOV campaign and for the Venezuelan Revolution. One particularly well-dressed gentleman, who identified himself as “an employee of an often unpopular financial institution,” who had been seen shaking his head and laughing throughout the film, asked the the HOV representative exactly “what is the rationale, as American citizens, for making such biased and bold political statements” in defense of a process which we “have no part in.” The comrade replied that we have every possible reason to make such statements in the United States and in every country, because the struggles of the Venezuelan workers and poor are the struggles of the working people in every country around the world. The struggle taking place in Venezuela knows no artificial boundaries, as the factory occupations in Chicago, France, the UK and other countries have shown in recent months. The workers of Venezuela are our brothers and sisters! This reply from HOV received the enthusiastic support of the crowd, with everyone clapping and calls of “that's right!” The crowd further delivered their own opinions about the subject and this particular representative of the financial elite was roundly admonished by the crowd in each case. When the meeting was formally closed, the HOV members were very touched by how many people stayed to chat with us informally about the process in Venezuela, the struggle at home, and the international work of the HOV campaign. Particularly we would like to thank the Venezuelan Embassy once again for providing the hall, attending the event, and making available refreshments to the attendees. Our thanks also goes out to all those individuals who came to the event, the delegation from the FMLN, and the encouraging words we received from all those present. This event was just the first of many and with the help of those who came to this film showing, we are sure to have even greater success in building the solidarity movement in the future. ¡Viva La Revolución!

			No Volveran: An Inspiration for the Workers in Jombang (Indonesia)",2009-04-24T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Novi – from SPBI (Indonesian Workers' Struggle Solidarity)"," No Volveran was screened for the first time in Jombang, a small city in the East Java, Indonesia. This screening event took place at the University Darul Ulum Jombang (UNDAR) on April 12 th and was organized by the Hands Off Venezuela branch in Malang. This documentary has been previously screened in a number of other cities in Indonesia. The documentary records the struggle of the Venezuelan people to reclaim their rights from the corrupt government of the fourth republic. Under the leadership of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan masses move toward a socialist society. The documentary No Volveran which was produced by the Hands Off Venezuela activists inspired workers in their struggle against capitalism. A number of workers and students from SPBI and SPM watched the revolutionary struggle that was waged by the Venezuelan masses which ended in a constitutional victory (the electoral victory of Chavez). This documentary conveyed a fighting spirit to the workers so that they are not afraid to build trade unions as a fighting organization to liberate themselves from the repression of the capitalists. Andy Irfan Junaidy, the secretary general of SPBI, in the discussion after the screening emphasized that the workers have to organize themselves and that trade union is a tool to strengthen the workers’ struggle. This could be seen from the experience of the workers in Venezuela who successfully occupied factories as a step toward socialism. It is important for us to see this film as a part of the workers struggle, of course by understanding the political and economic situation in Indonesia which is also ruled by the capitalists, as well as the electoral situation in Indonesia which is controlled by the interest of global capitalism. The revolutionary process in Venezuela can become an inspiration for us to put forward revolution as the only change. We will march forward to the gate of change by waging relentlessly the working class struggle toward socialism in Indonesia. The experience in Venezuela answers the doubt of the workers in Jombang who have been afraid to organize a union. The workers struggle cannot be done individually. At the end of the discussion, Andy asked those who were present to participate in building the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Indonesia and to build solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution.

													Jesus Syaiful Anam (HOV Indonesia)"," On March 3 rd 2009, together with the book launch of Permanent Revolution by Leon Trotsky, the formation of Hands Off Venezuela branch in Malang, East Java, was declared. The declaration took place at IKA Brawijaya Malang building and was attended by representatives from students and workers organizations. Those who were present were interested not only to show their solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution but also to discuss the Permanent Revolution book. Three speakers were invited to this event: Jesus SA (HOV Indonesia), Andi Irfan (SPBI, Indonesian Workers Struggle Solidarity), and Romo Robertus Wujanarko. The launch of HOV branch in Malang coincided very well with the launch of Permanent Revolution book. This was reflected in the questions asked by the participants that tied together Venezuelan Revolution, internationalism, and the theory of Permanent Revolution. Moreover, the discussion about Permanent Revolution provided a starting point for the revolutionary organizations of workers and students in Indonesia to acquaint themselves with the ideas of Trotsky that can become a guide to a systematic change in Indonesia. In connection with the Permanent Revolution, Jesus SA, the speaker from HOV Indonesia, also reviewed the failure of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in carrying its revolutionary task. PKI, as a party with huge mass base, which was supposed to carry the revolution in Indonesia, was destroyed because it adopted a wrong theory: the two-stage theory of Stalin. The publication of Permanent Revolution in Indonesia, according to Jesus SA, will provide a hope and a guide toward a socialist revolution. The launch of HOV Malang and Permanent Revolution book also showed the need to be in solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution, because this revolution could be the first step toward building a world-wide socialist revolution. Socialism cannot be built in one country. It has to go beyond national boundary.

			Cross-Canada Demonstration in Support of Venezuelan Referendum",2009-02-16T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV Canada and Société Bolivarienne du Québec."," Supporters of the Venezuelan revolution gathered in front of the Venezuelan consulate in Montreal on Sunday 15th of February at 11:00 am, in a demonstration called by Hands Off Venezuela/Société Bolivarienne du Québec. This was a cross-Canada event, as activists from Hands Off Venezuela Toronto, and the Mohawk community also traveled to increase the spirit of solidarity. All were united in solidarity with the revolution and the yes vote in the referendum abolishing term limits. Morale was high despite bitter cold, and intimidation attempts by opposition supporters, who called Montreal police to have the demonstrators removed. The supporters of the oligarchy became aggressive, assaulted the demonstration to take away a megaphone, and themselves were pushed back by the police instead. Alex Grant of HOV Toronto spoke to the demonstration and clearly pointed out the reason why the opposition supporters were so infuriated by our presence: the Venezuelan revolution is an example to the working class of the entire world, it shows that the capitalists and the oligarchs can be fought and overthrown by the mobilization of the toiling masses. Chavez has enraged the capitalists in Venezuela and internationally, as he has time and again come down on the side of the masses in their struggles against the few who previously concentrated enormous wealth and power in their hands. The Venezuelan Revolution has become the focal point of the hopes of millions, not just in Venezuela, but in every country on earth. In all the demonstrations in the Arab world against the imperialist slaughter perpetrated by the Israeli ruling class, Chavez’s picture was held high. From the perspective of the bourgeoisie, the message is clear: the masses must not be allowed to elect Chavez again. This is why the oligarchy, and the bourgeois press across the world, mobilized to prevent the people of Venezuela from freely deciding who they want as their president without restriction. The oligarchy cannot defeat Chavez in elections, so they must prevent him from running again. At noon, the demonstration marched to McGill University, where HOV/SBQ Montreal and visiting members of HOV Toronto held a public forum entitled “The Financial Crisis and the Bolivarian Revolution”. Joel Bergman, of HOV/SBQ Montreal, reminded the audience of the importance of the Venezuelan revolution, which has implemented massive social programs, raised living standards and nationalized whole industries. Joel emphasized the need to defend these gains against the attacks of the oligarchy. Camilo Cahis from HOV Toronto also spoke and pointed to governorships and mayoralties where the opposition has recently taken power, only to turn around and use these institutions to launch attacks against the communal councils, the social missions and the working class. They have even used these bases of power to organize armed fascist gangs, which have been roaming the streets with impunity. Both speakers underlined that this would pale in comparison to the bloody counter-revolution that would ensue if the opposition ever took hold of the presidency, and this is the practical reality which the masses took into account when voting yes for the referendum. However, the speakers pointed out that the oil boom which made all these reforms possible for a period under capitalism is now over, and the global economic crisis will force a resolution of the struggle in Venezuela one way or the other. If the revolution falters, the Venezuelan people face the prospect of inflation, mass unemployment and widespread lockouts to remove hard-won gains for the workers. This will be fertile ground for fascist gangs, who will not hesitate to settle their score with the masses, as they did in the massacres in Chile in 1973. There is another option. Comrades from Montreal and Toronto were united in calling for the revolution to move forward after the referendum, towards expropriating the oligarchs completely, taking away their power over the factories and the banks, and submitting them to the democratic control of the working class and the Venezuelan masses. So long as the oligarchs can still use these levers to attack the revolution, then the revolution is not irreversible. Already, the example of the occupied factories movement in Venezuela, placing factories under the control of workers’ councils, has inspired the first factory occupation since the 1930’s in the USA. Across the world, the exploited and oppressed are facing towards the fires of revolutionary struggle that are burning in Venezuela, and across Latin America. The demonstration and this forum were yet more proof that the Venezuelan people can count on their example being paid back in solidarity the world over. We gathered together for one reason, to call out: HANDS OFF VENEZUELA! {mosframe http://www.flickr.com/photos/27694962@N08/tags/montrealrallyforuminsupportofvenezuelanreferendum/show/,100%,450} Open the Gallery ",NA,NA

													HOV Poland"," In what is the 10 th anniversary of the Bolivarian Revolution, a meeting was held in the headquarters of the biggest Polish trade-union confederation to discuss the situation in this Latin American country. On February 2 nd, two members of the Venezuelan National Assembly - Carmen Alvarez and Ricardo Capella, were received by the leadership of the All Polish Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ). The OPZZ president Jan Guz, vice-president Wieslawa Taranowska, and Piotr Ostrowski, head of the OPZZ's international department were there. The meeting was co-organized by the Venezuelan embassy in Poland, OPZZ and the editors of the ""New Popular Weekly"" - a big Polish trade-union magazine who are members of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign as well. During the meeting a whole series of issues and questions were raised. Polish trade-unionists expressed their desire to learn more about the Venezuelan trade-union movement and its actions. A significant part of the meeting was devoted to the situation of women in Venezuela. Carmen and Ricardo explained that the position of women has improved in the last 10 years not because of the decrees and laws passed by President Chavez but, because of the constant day-to-day struggle of working women who fought for the application of these laws. The Venezuelan delegation also explained the content and significance of the upcoming constitutional amendment referendum. For their part, leaders of the OPZZ stressed that the union - as a left-wing organization - will always be in favor of pro-social actions in Venezuela and will always support the Venezuelan people in whatever decisions they make in a democratic process. The important part of the meeting was devoted also to the role of the media, both in Venezuela and in Poland. Bojan Stanislawski, deputy chief editor of the ""New Popular Weekly"" and an HOV supporter, expressed wholehearted support for the struggle against media terrorism. He also took up the question of recent events in Anzoategui where three workers were murdered by police while trying to evict them from the occupied Mitsubishi factory. Then, Wojciech Figiel made a short balance-sheet of the Bolivarian Revolution and urged the National Assembly of Venezuela to immediately pass a decree on expropriation of all occupied factories under workers control as the only viable way to finish with the domination and power of the oligarchy once and for all. He also made an appeal to resolve the conflict in Mitsubishi in favor of the protesting workers and asked members of the Venezuelan National Assembly present at the meeting to deliver the protest message concerning MMC workers directly to the President. Vice-chairperson of the OPZZ in turn expressed her solidarity with Venezuelan workers and urged the Venezuelan delegation to raise the issue of the repressed workers to President Chavez. At the end of the meeting a letter of protest, signed by the editors of the ""New Popular Weekly"" was handed to the delegation from Venezuela. This meeting was a very positive step forward for consolidating and strengthening the relations between Venezuela and the Polish trade-union movement. It also showed the interest with which Polish trade unionists are following events in Venezuela. It was a part of the coordinated effort to publicize the case of the repressed workers of Mitsubishi that has been taken up by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign internationally. ",NA,NA

			Joint Meeting London – Victory in Bolivia & Ten Years of the Venezuelan Revolution",2009-02-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													William Roche","Around 40 peopled gathered together at Bolivar Hall London last night to attend a meeting, organised by Hands Off Venezuela and the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign, to celebrate and discuss the recent constitutional victory in Bolivia, and the ten-year anniversary of the Venezuelan revolution. The new Bolivian constitution is a big step forward for the revolution. It is the first constitution to have been formed by a peoples’ assembly, and gives Bolivians new democratic powers. Amancay Colque, Secretary of the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign, described how the State now has constitutional powers to take control of the country’s natural resources, including hydrocarbons, which have been plundered by foreign multinationals for decades. Amancay also outlined the new rights for indigenous peoples. They now have the right to political representation at all levels. They are also entitled to autonomy should they wish it. This is of course a key issue in a country where over half the population are indigenous. Most importantly, the new constitution gives power to the working class, allowing them to challenge the exploitation of employers by entitling them to defend their jobs through industrial action, including the occupation of factories and workers’ control. Direct control over work places through workers councils would help to form the embryo of a new socialist society. An important ally to Bolivia, the Venezuelan revolution, has now reached its ten-year anniversary. The achievements so far have inspired millions worldwide. Social spending per person has tripled, poverty halved, free healthcare expanded, illiteracy eradicated, unemployment fallen, and wage inequality reduced. Nestor Lopez, First Secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy, outlined some of the achievements, and explained how the Venezuelan Government has funded social welfare programs by regaining control of the nation’s oil industry, previously under the control of the corrupt oligarchy. Nestor also supported the constitutional amendment being voted on this Sunday 15 th Feb to abolish term limits for officials. Nestor pointed out that officials, including the President, would still be subject to democratic elections. “If this is the will of the majority, then the abolition of term limits is surely democratic.” Nestor finished by saying that for the revolution to move forward, complete control of the State by the people must be achieved. The ten-year anniversary of the Venezuelan revolution was marred last month by the brutal killing of two workers, and the wounding of several others, during an illegal police eviction of workers who had occupied the Mitsubishi factory in protest of severe job cuts. Police have already been arrested in connection with these unlawful killings, but this incident shows that the Venezuelan revolution is far from complete. Jorge Martin, International Secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, also referred to the abolition of term limits, pointing out that “we have no term limits here in Britain, or the US, or Canada for example”. Jorge also commented on how the worldwide mass media are blindly repeating the distorted views of the Venezuelan oligarchy, who are presenting this amendment as a violation of democracy, using phrases like ‘Chavez President for life’ , and ‘Indefinite re-election’ . Jorge explained that the right-wing opposition to the amendment is in no way an attempt to defend democracy, instead it’s a disguised struggle against democracy. They do not want the revolution to continue because it threatens the interests of the rich. It is, of course, ironic that these supposed ‘concerns’ over democracy are being waged by the very same people who attempted the overthrow of the democratically elected Chavez government in 2002. It’s also worth pointing out that Venezuela is the only country in the world to have the democratic right to recall any official, including the President, should they wish it. The audience seemed inspired by the speakers. Many interesting questions were asked, and many interesting contributions were made, including one lady who pointed out that, though Bolivians were very pleased with the new constitution, they also felt it wasn’t revolutionary enough, especially on the question of land reform. Jorge Martin responded by saying that, although parliament and constitutions can play an important role in a mass movement, the revolution can only be completed by the masses themselves. All three speakers finished by stressing the importance of international solidarity. Amancay called for working people around the world to embrace the Bolivian constitution as their own. Nestor referred to Karl Marx, and stressed that revolution requires great strength and determination. And, Jorge stressed that the struggle in Latin America to build peoples power and socialism is a solution for the oppressed and exploited all over the world. “Let’s make sure that the 21 st Century is a century of socialism, not capitalism”.",NA,NA

			3 trade union leaders killed in Aragua - HOV statement",2008-12-01T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","Three leading trade unionists were killed in Aragua, Venezuela, on the night of Thursday, November 27. One was the coordinator of the UNT in Aragua, another was the chair of the union at Pepsi-Cola and the third was heavily involved in health and safety issues. The three of them had spent the day helping out the workers at Alpina, a Colombian-based dairy company, where workers are in struggle and had been brutally attacked by the regional police. The outgoing regional governor, Didalco Boliviar, was elected on a Bolivarian ticket and then joined the opposition. He was ousted on Sunday 23rd, when PSUV candidate Rafael Isea won the regional elections in Aragua. The method use to kill these three trade unionists is that of sicariato (political assassination by hired killers), commonly used in Colombia against trade union activists. On Friday there were work stoppages and road blockades in Aragua and on Saturday thousands turned out to the funeral procession. All this is happening in the context of increased provocations by right wing activists against the social programmes of the Bolivarian government (misiones) in those regions where the opposition won the regional elections (Miranda, Bolivar and Tachira). Statement by Hands Off Venezuela The Hands off Venezuela campaign has learnt news of the killing of 3 leading trade unionists in Aragua, Venezuela, on November 27th. Ricard Gallardo, Luis Hernandez and Carlos Requena, were killed at the end of a day in which they had been supporting the struggle of workers at the Colombian-owned Alpina company, facing heavy police repression. An injury to one is an injury to all! Long live the Bolivarian revolution! Long live international solidarity!

After handing out leaflets and speaking to the public outside, the demonstrators were invited into the Consulate to meet with the Consulate General, Dr. Edgar A. González. He was given several letters on behalf of various Brazilian groups, all expressing their solidarity with the Venezuelan workers at this time, but also condemning those responsible for such a brutal act and asking for a full investigation. Dr. González then spoke, thanking everyone very much for turning up and expressing their solidarity. He talked about the problems of right-wing governors who have ""hijacked"" certain states since the last elections, and how there still exists a serious internal threat in Venezuela. He assured us, however, that the investigation into the killings has already been taken to the highest level in Venezuela. He then went on to talk about the vital importance of Latin American unity and the global struggle for Socialism of the 21st Century. He said the letters presented by the groups would go to Venezuela and to Chávez himself. He also made a point of condeming the ongoing imperialist attacks on Venezuela, from the right-wing media in Brazil, to the ""imperialist"" EU. Finally, he invited all members back to meet again in January, and said he would do everything he can, going to speak in favelas, putting on events, to help spread the message about 21st Socialism and the Bolivarian Revolution.

			Petition for the Indigenous Peoples of Colombia",2008-10-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV Finland","Hands Off Venezuela Finland has written a petition against the repression of the indigenous population of Colombia. We publish the text in full here. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations asserts that all human beings – and this includes also the Indigenous Peoples of Latin America - are born free and equal in dignity and rights, endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. Any person representing Colombian Indigenous Peoples may, equally well as any citizen of Finland, demand the rights and liberties granted in the Universal Declaration, no matter what the political, administrative, or international situation may be. Every Indigenous person on the planet must have the right to life, freedom and personal security. Under the terms of the government proposed draft Constitution of the Republic of Bolivia, which will be subjected to national referendum, Bolivia is a democratic unitary plurinational, intercultural and decentralized State of representative democracy. Article 2 stipulates that sovereignty resides in the people, that it is inalienable, and that its exercise is delegated to the legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Specifically, the draft stipulates that the Indigenous Peoples will be returned the right to their lands, inherited from their ancestry, which belonged to them before the advent of colonialism. The draft guarantees them the right to cultural identity and self-administration in the form of municipal, regional and indigenous autonomy and the reconstruction of their lands. According to President Morales, “Before the Spanish conquest these lands belonged to the Indigenous Peoples, and they must be returned to them.” In Bolivia, the Guarani People have already been returned the rights to an area of more than 900, 000 acres. The State has the right to confiscate lands that are not being used for purposes such as agriculture or commerce. In Colombia, a civil war has been waged for 43 years. The parties of the war are the Colombian army, supported by the U.S. and their partner the AUC (United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia), the other side represented by the biggest leftist guerilla movements FARC-EL and ELN. The AUC consists of several ultra-right paramilitary groups, supported by the big landowners, the drug lords and a part of the armed forces. The ethnic groups of Colombia consist of indigenous Amerindian peoples, descendants of white immigrants, of slaves from Africa, and mixed populations. The Constitution of 1991 formally recognized the rights of the indigenous peoples but forgot to fulfill their demands for their own lands. In 1999, President Andres Pastrana advanced a proposal for 'Plan Colombia', with the goal of social and economical revival of the country by ending the armed conflict and creating a strategy against illicit drugs. The objectives of Plan Colombia have subsequently been altered to accord with specific political and military goals in Latin America of the United States and to accelerate the opening of inter-American markets by trade liberalization, as expressed in the Free Trade Area Agreement of Americas. The incumbent President of Colombia, Alvaro Úribe, represents the Liberal Party. He became leader of the country in 2002. He acts as both head of the country and head of the Government. He saw it fit to grow the military budget as well as collaboration with the U.S. in order to weed out production of illicit drug industry and leftist guerilla movements. Upon his visit to Colombia in 2002, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell described the U.S. attitude towards Colombia as follows: “Together, we renewed our commitment to work toward our common goals of strengthening democracy, increasing respect for human rights, combating drugs and terrorism, and especially, and perhaps most importantly, widening the circle of economic prosperity to include all Colombians within that circle.” To advance these goals, the U.S. provided Colombia with 1.8 billion dollars in assistance. The Government led by President Alvaro Úribe enhances the Colombian democracy and respects the human rights of the Indigenous Peoples in a rather peculiar manner: by systematically suppressing them. On September 29, 2008, AUC troops killed the Indigenous leader Raúl Mendoza in his home. On October 12, in the Department of Cauca, armed units of the National Police and the Colombian Army backed by helicopters and tanks attacked Indigenous persons and peasants who demonstrated peacefully against the deadly policies of the Government and multinational corporations. The demonstrators demanded basic rights, freedom, autonomy and fair division of land. The National Authority of the Indigenous Government (ONIC) reports that during the last seven years 1,125 Indigenous persons have been killed and 18 Indigenous Peoples have been pushed to the brink of extinction. A total of 450,000 Indigenous persons have been confiscated of their land. Over 600 children in the Choco Region died from undernourishment and preventable diseases. Three million Colombians have fled from the country. Four hundred thousand families have lost their homes. The homes of 4 million persons have been forcefully relocated. The number of disappeared persons hovers around 30,000. Five thousand death sentences have been enforced outside the justice system. Hundreds of teachers, journalists and trade unionists have been killed. Some six million hectares of best land is owned and controlled by drug barons, politicians and the AUC. Free trade agreements with the U.S., Canada and the European Union have opened roads to the exploitation andof the rights, cultures, knowledge, lands and economic values of the Indigenous Peoples, with the practices of forced labor and exclusion of these Peoples, including outright terror. This is unacceptable to us. We condemn the said malpractices of the Government of Colombia. We demand that it stops its exploitation and oppression practiced toward the Indigenous Peoples of Colombia and respects their human rights. We also demand that the Indigenous Peoples are granted autonomy and legal right to the possession of their traditionally owned and occupied land as their exclusive property.

			“People’s Power” (“The Battle of Chile III”) screened in London",2008-11-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Mauro Vanetti"," On Wednesday, October 5th, in Bolívar Hall in London, 25 people attended the screening of “People's Power” ( “El poder popular” ) the third part of “The Battle of Chile” ( “La batalla de Chile” ), by Patricio Guzmán. This film was produced in 1979, some years after the first two parts of “The Battle of Chile” had already become a “classic” on the development and defeat of the Chilean Revolution and the Allende government. This film focuses on “People’s Power”, i.e. the formation of grassroots movements and organisations that challenged the old structure of Chilean society in an attempt to revolutionise the whole system. Workers, peasants and youth organised first to break the resistance of the bosses and then moved on to use People’s Power in a more creative way, as the embryo of a new society. Several forms of People’s Power and the related problems are shown in the film alongside the development of the political situation on a national scale. First of all, the workers tried to defend their jobs, the economy of their country, their government and the revolution itself, from the first vicious lockout organised by the bosses of the trucking industry. The whole Chilean transport system was paralysed from October 11 th , 1972, causing huge disruption to the economy. The counter-revolutionary attack was initially launched by the rightist National Party and the confederation of trucking companies, but one by one all the reactionary parties (including the Christian Democrats) and middle-class associations of the country fell into line in backing the seditious strike. In some factories, the bosses’ sabotage went to the point that the owners, managers and technicians abandoned the plants. In this context, the workers started to fight back. A parallel transport system was organised from below to transport the workers and the raw materials and get them to the factories. Trucks owned by the nationalised factories became improvised buses for the workers. Abandoned factories were reorganised under workers’ control and with the aid of those few technicians, engineers etc., who kept on working (in some cases being “shared” by several companies). In the film we can see how the workers did not really miss their bosses very much: In this way the appeal against the strike launched by the government was successful and the right wing was temporarily defeated. Another field where People’s Power was effectively used was in the war against hoarding. The US blockade spurred hoarding by shopkeepers, middlemen, speculators etc., who exploited to their advantage the dramatic shortage of supplies. The government issued strict laws to punish the hoarders and to establish central control on stocks and supplies, but this would have remained on paper without mass support and participation. Some factories, through their trade union organisations, started to sell their products directly to the working-class neighbourhoods and community warehouses (the “people’s warehouses” set up in 1973 as consumer co-operatives to bypass the profiteers). The film makers comment: “Other factories send pickets of workers to open the closed stores. These workers play the role of inspectors at the service of the government.” We clearly had the beginnings of dual power: the official power of the bourgeois state and the capitalists, and “People’s Power”, i.e. the power of the working class and the revolutionary peasantry. The vital need to oppose hoarding and violent terrorist attacks by CIA-backed Fascists compelled the organs of People’s Power to organise vigilante committees and armed detachments, even though the central government would always stubbornly refuse to arm the people – an approach that was to prove fatal in September 1973. The good results of the enterprises belonging to the “social sector” (nationalised and under workers’ control) eventually frustrated the counter-revolutionary plot and convinced the Christian Democracy to temporarily reject the more extremist tactics, trying to reach a deal with Allende and water down the political line of the government. In order to get the support of the Christian Democrats, Allende incorporated the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces into a new cabinet that combined top military officers (like General Carlos Prats, who would be assassinated by Pinochet’s agents in 1974) with civilians. The workers interviewed in the movie gave a generally favourable response to this change. Many of the same workers who were striving to create People’s Power still had illusions that the army could be reliably used to smash the counter-revolution – this demonstrates the contradictory character of the movement. The following dialogue between the interviewer and a factory worker shows a typical point of view: This attempt would be tragically revealed as a blind alley a few months later, but it did not prevent People’s Power from continuing to develop parallel to the suicidal constitutional path. This alarmed the more moderate parties on the Left, afraid of the spontaneous activity of the masses, almost as much as the ruling class itself. The Industrial Belts ( Cordones Industriales ), especially Cordón Cerrillos , constituted the most advanced example. They were genuine forms of workers’ democracy: co-ordinating committees of organised workers that took control of their workplaces. The similarities between these bodies of workers’ power and the original Russian soviets (of the pre-Stalin era) are striking. Formed at the end of the October conflict, the Cerrillos Industrial Belt comprised 250 businesses from the Southern part of Santiago. People’s Power also became a means of forming a united front between the working class and the peasantry. The documentary shows how the peasants in the village of Maipú relied on support by detachments of workers from the Industrial Belts to occupy and expropriate estates owned by big landlords and reorganise production in a co-operative manner. In the same scene, we can witness a conflict between the spontaneous struggle of the masses and the limitations of the “legal path”, represented by the pernicious role of the state bureaucracy in charge of “organising” (in fact, restraining) the land reform. The judiciary placed one thousand legal obstacles in the way of the peasants in struggle, trying in different ways to hand the estates back to their “legitimate” owners, and the government and its officers did not intervene. The experience of workers’ control under the most difficult siege conditions sparked proletarian creativity applied to the daily problems of production. In the plants, political and economic discussion covered all aspects of the struggle. In the film we could see how the most advanced layers of the working class recognised the basic contradiction of dual power: nationalised companies under workers’ control could not survive for a prolonged period alongside a state that preserved its capitalist character and an economic system still dominated to a large extent by private profit. The demand raised in the workers’ meetings is openly for the establishment of a collective economy democratically planned from below: in other words, a genuine transition to socialism. The word “socialism” sounds much more concrete and practical if you associate it with the images of the organised workers autonomously managing production, distribution and public order. This is certainly a very precious video document on what a revolution truly looks like. Watching this movie, you can’t help thinking that just within the official shell of any capitalist society (not only Chile in the Seventies, but also every capitalist country in our times) lies a sort of dormant energy that is only waiting to be unleashed. Repressed and forcibly prevented from surfacing in “normal” times, it is a new order maturing “within the womb of the old society” , as Marx said, that emerges in a revolutionary conjuncture. What the Chilean activists and the film itself call “People’sPower” are the elements of a new order based on workers’ democracy and control, mass participation based on political awareness and class consciousness, collective ownership of the means of production, reorganisation of the economy on the basis of needs instead of profit. After all, having – more or less consciously– unleashed this energy is the main sin that Salvador Allende and tens of thousands of Chilean leftists and revolutionaries paid for with their lives or with years of prison, torture, humiliation or exile. But, in so doing, the bourgeoisie is only sweeping its own dirt under the carpet. A Question & Answer session followed the screening, with the participation of comrade Sara De Witt and other ex Chilean political prisoners. There were some questions on the reforms implemented by Salvador Allende and the level of support he enjoyed. While it is clear that in those few years and under such terrible conditions, and as it was confined within the limits of capitalism, the revolution could not really obtain much, Sara explained how the foundations for very radical changes were actually in place and this triggered a wave of enthusiasm especially among the most exploited layers of society, that reflected itself in a steady increase of electoral support for Unidad Popular . At the same time, Chilean society was extremely polarised, which is what we have to expect in any revolutionary situation, and the Right also did have some base of support. There was a question asking why the so-called “socialist bloc” could not help Chile in establishing socialism. The author of this report answered that question, expressing the opinion that, even if revolutions cannot be simply “imported”, the opportunism and bureaucratisation of the leaderships of both the USSR and the People’s Republic of China had had a very negative role in the whole process. Realpolitik and the acceptance of the “Monroe doctrine” that identified Latin America as the backyard of the White House always determined the actions of both Moscow and Beijing. Also the Cuban revolution was anything but the result of a conscious support by Khrushchev. The leaders of the Communist Party of Chile, with strong links to the Kremlin, had always sided with the most moderate wing of the movement, warning against any kind of revolutionary action by the masses. China even went to the extent of establishing very friendly diplomatic relations with Pinochet, on the basis that the Chinese leaders tended to always do the opposite of what the Soviet leaders did (the USSR had at least broken all diplomatic relations with Chile after the coup). A very young member of the audience asked a question about the role of teachers in those years and what the government did for young children. Sara replied that the Allende government was very active in improving the conditions of schools, extending and improving education for poor children, which motivated many teachers in getting more involved in the struggle and siding with the revolution. Another question was about the opinion of the Chileans today about what happened in those months of turmoil. Different opinions were expressed about the changes that have taken place in Chilean society since 1973. Some said that society has become much more affected by consumerism and there is a lack of strong ideals, but Sara underlined the fact that after such a tragic defeat you can only expect that people want to forget for some time. The same has happened in any other country after the workers have been defeated in an important struggle, but it never prevented the new generation from starting again from where their parents were forced to stop. Comparisons were also drawn, once again, with the current situation in Venezuela – this was in fact the reason why Hands Off Venezuela promoted this film screening series! “People’s Power” is strong in Venezuela too and very similar processes are unfolding in that country. “Crear / crear / poder popular” is a slogan as relevant now as it was in 1972-73!

			Successful 4th National Conference for HOV Britain",2008-11-24T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Hands Off Venezuela Britain held its 4th annual conference on Saturday November 22nd at Birckbeck College, London. The opening address was given by Darrall Cozens, who stressed that the aims of the campaign have always to support the reforms of the Bolivarian revolution and to counteract the lies and distortions of the media. Sunday's elections were very important, he added, and with the global economic crisis and falling oil prices pointing towards a difficult future, a strong performance in these elections was vital. HOV joint president and NUJ General Secretary Jeremy Dear spoke next. The Venezuelan process was reminiscent of a famous pamphlet on Nicaragua published in the 1980s entitled ""The threat of a good example"", on why that country had become the target for US intervention. Venezuela has not become a paradise overnight, he continued, but we should celebrate its achievements such as free education, poverty being halved and illiteracy eradicated. Jeremy also stressed the importance of Sunday’s elections, with a rising threat to the revolution from both inside and outside. There is no appeasing irreconcilable interests and solidarity is essential. Venezuelan ambassador to London Samuel Moncada was next to speak. He pointed out that this was the first time in Venezuela's history that a constitution exists that has been approved by popular vote, and this constitution has redesigned the distribution of power from elites to the masses. There is a new self-esteem, dignity and respect in the country and the masses are still challenging the government, and the government is not teaching the masses but learning from them. Ambassador Moncada also spoke of the problem of corruption. The challenge is to confront and overcome our own failures, he said. Some Chavista candidates turn out to be corrupt and, as he pointed out, this is not a revolution of saints, but the drive to confront corruption is sincere. On the election of Barack Obama he pointed out that as nice as the man may seem, he is still head of an empire - we must extend our hands, preparing for the worst but expecting the best. Labour MP and HOV Joint President John McDonnell spoke next. Our role in defending Venezuela is crucial in this period of financial turmoil as Venezuela will not be immune. He talked of the legacy of poverty in Venezuela and that the Chávez administration being the first to tackle it and to transfer power to the grass roots. Still, it takes time to turn things around in the face of destabilisation from the US-backed opposition. We have a responsibility to counter propaganda and to defend this revolution from attack, he concluded. FBU General Secretary Matt Wrack was next to speak. He told us of the strong tradition of internationalism at the FBU, adding that after being told for 30 years that the state should be far removed from the market, suddenly there is a wave of nationalisation. But nationalisation of losses, with future privatisation of profit. Now we need an alternative. This is why Venezuela is so important to working people in Britain. Venezuela workers are discussing how to organise society, which is a world away from what is happening in Britain. He ended by saying that the media will not tell the truth about Venezuela, so we must. The final speaker was Jesús Pino, from the Revolutionary Front of Steel Workers at SIDOR, the nationalised steel company. Jesús spoke of the enormous interest in the process of change in Venezuela. He is from the Orinoco steel works, one of the largest steel companies in Venezuela, nationalised this year. The company had been privatised in 1997, after which conditions for the workers deteriorated, with many fatalities. However, steel workers have a militant tradition, as was shown when the multinational owner refused to meet workers demands in 2007. In March 2008, the National Guard attacked workers, ordered to do so by the then Minister of Labour, who was promptly fired. The Vice-President was appointed mediate in negotiations, but when the multinational refused to budge, President Chávez decided to nationalise. The nationalised company had to be productive, but also had to be a socialist company - how? This involves workers’ control of management and distribution of resources. There had not been much experience of worker control in large companies, so they set up the revolutionary front of steel workers, with the aim of overthrowing the capitalist structures still within the company. He ended by saying the only way to face the upcoming crisis is with the unity of all workers in a revolutionary trade union. There then followed three fascinating and productive workshops on Socialism of the 21st Century, Workers' Control, and Latin American Solidarity, after which the conference was wrapped up by HOV founder Alan Woods and Jesús Pino who urged the unity of working people and to continue the struggle to defend the Bolivarian revolution. The HOV conference also passed the following resolution in solidarity with Venezuela and voted a new Steering Committee for the campaign. {mosframe http://picasaweb.google.com/niklasalbin/HovConference2008AndJesusPino#slideshow/,100%,450} Open the Gallery See: videos from the conference .

													Hands Off Venezuela"," Come and hear Jesus Pino from the Revolutionary Front of Steel Workers (SIDOR). He is speaking at the Hands Off Venezuela National Conference in London in less than two week’s time. He will speak about the struggle to nationalise the steel industry and the fight for workers’ control in Venezuela. The nationalisation of SIDOR earlier this year was a direct outcome of a militant struggle by the steel workers themselves. This shows the direction that the Venezuelan Revolution is taking and highlights the need to complete the tasks of expropriating the Oligarchy. Other speakers include John McDonnell MP, Matt Wrack (FBU), Bob Crow (RMT), Jeremy Dear (NUJ), Alan Woods (author of ‘the Venezuelan Revolution’), Derek Wall (spokesperson for the Green Party), Samuel Moncada (the Venezuelan Ambassador), and others. There will also be workshops on Green Venezuela, Socialism of 21 st century, workers’ control, and solidarity with the Latin American Revolution. The Conference will be held on 22 November in the Main Lecture Theatre, Clore Management Centre, Birkbeck College, Torrington Sq., London WC1 (nearest tubes: Goodge Street & Russell Square).

			Report of Jorge Martin’s trip to Malaysia and Indonesia",2008-11-25T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Indonesia"," This article is also available in Bahasa Indonesia . In the ""21 st Century Socialism Conference"" which was hosted by the Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM, Parti Sosialis Malaysia) from November 7 th to 9 th at New Era College Kajang Malaysia: there were comrades present from many countries, including Sweden, Belgium, Australia, Britain, Pakistan, Nepal, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, India, and Sri Lanka. Jorge Martin spoke in the session about the Venezuelan revolution and Latin America, together with Lisa MacDonald from the Australia-Venezuela Solidarity network. Jorge explained the background to the current revolutionary wave that the continent is witnessing which is to be found in the failure of capitalism to solve the basic needs of the people. The Venezuelan revolution started from the point of view of solving problems of health, education, national control over natural resources, agrarian reform, etc, but it was met with an armed uprising on the part of the oligarchy. From 2005 president Chavez started to explain that the only way forward was socialism and that capitalism cannot solve the pressing problems that the masses face. Now, according to Jorge, the global economic crisis of capitalism can provide a momentum for the working class to build a fighting force on an international scale. Building solidarity amongst workers from different countries is important to face the current global crisis. The working class has to prepare itself to replace this capitalist system in crisis with socialism, taking over the factories, banks, and big businesses to run them under democratic workers' control. According to Jorge only a working class which is united internationally can carry out the revolution. Apart from Jorge Martin, Jesus S. Anam, the coordinator of HOV-Indonesia spoke at a session on ""Political Coalition"". He also mentioned the importance of building the forces of the revolutionary left (from the workers, peasants, and urban poor). Transformation in the ideology and political consciousness at all levels are necessary to build a strong organization, especially a workers' organization as the most important base for a revolution. According to Jesus, in the context of Indonesia, the main priority in the left movement today is to build strong cadres with a high level of militancy. Building solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution is a way of building that force together as the Venezuelan Revolution can become the starting point for world socialist revolution. Jorge arrived at the occupied factory, PT Istana, with KASBI comrades (Konggres Aliansi Serikat Buruh Indonesia, Congress of Indonesia Trade Unions Alliance). The trip from the secretariat office of KASBI to PT Istana was delayed by a flood due to rising ocean tides (a very common occurrence in Jakarta) that caused quite a long traffic jam. With a placard saying ""Selamat Datang Jorge Martin"" (""Welcome Jorge Martin""), the workers received Jorge Martin and the KASBI group and then had lunch together in one of the rooms in the factory. The workers of PT Istana have occupied the factory for 15 months. The workers are composed of 75 women and 2 men. After giving Jorge a tour of the factory, the workers had a discussion with him. In that discussion, present were members of the PRP (Perhimpunan Rakyat Pekerja, Working People's Association), ABM (Aliansi Buruh Menggugat, Workers' Challenge Alliance), FPBJ (Federasi Perjuangan Buruh Jabotabek, Federation of Workers' Struggle of Jabotabek) and SMI (Serikat Mahasiswa Indonesia, Indonesian Students Union). The number of people in that discussion was more than 100. The discussion continued for more than 3 hours from 3pm to 6pm. Jorge explained the revolutionary process in Venezuela, the occupation and takeover of many factories there, including the spectacular takeover of the oil industry [Note: during the oil sabotage in 2002-2003].. Workers continued the production without managers, directors, and other sectors that control technology. Moreover, Jorge explained the need to consolidate the workers, to get the support of other workers' organizations at large, to cooperate with other workers' organizations in the marketing and production process, and also how to survive under the pressure and logistical limitations in running the factory. Jorge also elaborated on the continual sabotage and threat from the capitalist oligarchy. In the long term, he explained, one cannot have socialism in one factory, and the movement of factory occupations can only succeed if it becomes part of the more general struggle of the working class for nationalisation and workers' control of the decissive sectors of the economy. Jorge emphasized the importance of intensive consolidation and raising the consciousness of the working class massively so that there will be other factories that can be occupied, not just PT Istana. The emergence of a wider occupation movement will help the next stage of the workers' movement, just like in Argentine. The discussion was quite intense. A number of people asked about the current condition of the Venezuelan workers, government support, the role of student organizations. There were also questions about the condition of Indonesian workers who are now facing the issue of the contract system, outsourcing, below standard wages, and massive layoffs. Jorge summarized all those issues with an explanation that the source of these workers' problems is the exploitative capitalist system. The current financial crisis has shown that the rottenness of capitalism is a sign that the system is not secure anymore. The meeting was ended with a gift from the workers to Jorge and also the singing of the Internationale. (The University of Indonesia is the oldest public university in the country, dating back to 1851. It is one of the most militant universities that led the student movement which toppled the Soeharto regime in 1998). The ""Global Economic Crisis"" is the issue that Jorge talked about to the audience of the discussion panel, numbering around 70 people. The audience came from both trade union and academic backgrounds and it had been organised in collaboration with the Sociology Laboratory of the UI. Other than Jorge, there were three other speakers in the panel: Anwar Ma'ruf (coordinator of ABM), Dodik (the president of SB PLN, Union of the State Electricity Company), and Silvia Tiwon (Praxis). Jorge explained clearly that the current global crisis is a sign of the rottenness of the capitalist system. The big gains of capitalism apparently rest on a very fragile footing. The correct solution to solve this crisis is to replace capitalism with socialism: nationalize the oil and gas industry, the banks, and all the important sectors of the economy under the control of the people. Anwar Ma'ruf also expounded the same idea, that socialism is the only solution to this crisis. Silvia Tiwon from Praxis had a rather different perspective from Jorge and Anwar. One main point in Silvia's explanation is that educating the people is the starting point to face the crisis. This point of view brings forth a very critical question: can this rotting crisis be solved with partial measures? At the end of the meeting, one comrade commented that this was an historical meeting, probably the first time that the ideas of socialism were discussed at an official meeting at UI in more than 40 years. Why socialism? Why solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution? Is Venezuela a socialist country? What is the role of the working class in the Venezuelan Revolution? These are questions asked by members of the Student Study Group at the National University who were enthusiastic to hear critical and scientific explanations from Jorge Martin. As Jorge explained in the previous events: capitalism has been proven to be a failure. The ""free market"" with its unbridled quest for profits has led to overproduction. This overproduction forces the capitalists to sell their commodities cheaply. As a result, these companies face immediate bankruptcy and collapse. The effect of this bankruptcy is mass layoffs of workers and an explosion of unemployment. It is the workers who are forced to pay for this loss, not the bosses. The only solution is to takeover the key economic sectors (banks, land and important industries), put them under the democratic control of the workers through a socialist plan of production. During the ten years of the Venezuelan revolution, we can see how the masses have defended the revolution against the oligarchy: in the 2002 coup followed by the bosses' sabotage, the 2004 referendum, and the 2006 presidential election. The courage of the workers and the masses of Venezuela is an important inspiration for the oppressed masses and workers throughout the world and is a starting point to build the forces of the toiling people in various countries. By building solidarity with Venezuela, it means we are building socialist forces all over the world. As Trotsky explained, we cannot build socialism in one country; it has to go beyond the borders of nations. Indeed, according to Jorge, Venezuela is not yet a socialist country, the revolution needs to be completed or it will be defeated. On Thursday November 13 th , Jorge had an intense discussion with members of the PRP in their central office in Jakarta. The PRP, as the main organizer of Jorge's trip to Indonesia, is very keen to learn about the experience of factory occupations in Venezuela. Collaboration between the HOV campaign and the PRP is very possible in the near future, because consolidating workers internationally is an important point for HOV. The PRP as a revolutionary workers' organization in Indonesia can be a partner in building this force locally as well as internationally. Attended by around 35 factory workers from several workers' organizations, Jorge was the main speaker in a discussion hosted by the PRP and KASBI in the city of Bandung. The HOV Bandung comrades were also present in that discussion. Jorge outlined to them the revolutionary process in Venezuela. The role of the masses that took the streets demanding the return of Chavez during the coup was a phenomenon never seen before in the history. The workers and the masses united to stop the coup that was being carried out by the oligarchy with the support of the capitalist media. After that, Jorge explained the condition of factory occupations in Venezuela, where Chavez fully supports the process and workers' control of factories. He also explained the sabotage and the attempts by the oligarchy to destroy the revolutionary process toward socialism in Venezuela. Several of those taking part in the discussion asked questions about the role of that wing of the military which is pro-worker in Venezuela, on how to run factories without logistic and technical support, how to open the market which is not yet controlled, the legal basis of the occupations, and also the situation of the workers' organizations in Venezuela, and other organizations that support the struggle of the workers. Jorge emphasized the fact that the challenges facing the revolution in Indonesia and in Venezuela are similar (an abundance of natural resources, a huge part of the population living in poverty, foreign aid which controls the government, such as the IMF, World Bank, etc, and also the military which is opposed to the workers' struggle). But we have to learn from Venezuela that political momentum and the situation can transform the class consciousness to become an effective political movement. Jorge closed the discussion by saying that differences in language, culture and country are not an obstacle to the spirit of solidarity in supporting workers' struggles everywhere, since the working class is one international class with common enemies, common interests and a common struggle In room 29 of the Campus Centre of ITB (Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung Institute of Technology), Jorge Martin was present as the main speaker in the launching of the Bandung chapter of HOV-Indonesia. The launch event was opened with the screening of ""No Volveran"" that recounts the revolutionary process and socialist measures that have been carried out in Venezuela. In that film, we can also see how the masses of Venezuela can organize themselves and the workers who are taking over the factories and running them without the help of managers and technicians. This launching of HOV Bandung was initiated by the Journal Ganesha ITB and individuals who agree with the principles of the HOV campaign. In this discussion, Jorge explained that the present democracy in Venezuela cannot yet be used as a basis for genuine democracy, because several elements of power are still in the hands of the oligarchy and the capitalists. However, the process of the mass movement which is organized through communal councils and trade unions that can occupy the factories in Venezuela has raised the consciousness of the people. They fight the oligarchy by transforming democracy into ""participatory democracy"", and this is a starting point to build socialism in Venezuela. This discussion drew the conclusion that capitalism is not the end and that participatory democracy is the first step that can bring people to engage in politics and to take decisions in public measures, and direct the masses toward socialism. In this case, Venezuela is one of the concrete examples of transforming the oligarchic system (read: bourgeoisie democracy) into participatory democracy and building socialism based on the consciousness of the people. However, Jorge insisted that unless the old structures of the capitalist state are done away with, one cannot have genuine democracy. This launch event was closed with a call from Roliv, the coordinator of HOV Bandung, to officially establish the building of this solidarity campaign and to ask all progressive elements in Bandung to join the campaign, and to learn about the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela in order to explore the prospects of revolution in Indonesia through the lessons of Venezuela.

													HOV Belgium"," 150 people gathered in Brussels on Saturday, November 15 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the revolution. At the same time they drew up a balance sheet of the gains of the revolution and discussed the future of Venezuela and the Latin-American continent. The great diversity of participants is the first thing to be noticed: Latinos, Dutch and French speaking people, youth and trade unionists, all of them looking to Venezuela as an example and the beginning of a better and more just society, socialism, in the making. The activity started with an opening speech by Guy Tordeur, the regional leader of the Christian union. “Casino capitalism is in crisis. That’s why alternative experiments as we see in Venezuela are so important and need more publicity”. Indeed the number of activities and interest for Venezuela in trade union circles is on the increase. We are witnessing a greater involvement of some unions in search of a left alternative. Tordeur also issued a call for a larger and better organized international union movement in this globalised world. He stressed the need for cross-border collaboration and concluded that the struggle in Venezuela is also our struggle. Finally he pleaded also for the international recognition of the UNT by the unions. A debate on the international economic crisis followed, with the ambassador of Bolivia, diplomats of Venezuela and Cuba and also Eric Toussaint, chairman of the Committee for the Cancellation of the Third World Debt taking part. The ambassador of Bolivia, Mr. Enchauste, highlighted the paradox of capitalist countries that have been forced to engage in nationalization as a result of the financial meltdown. This comment was widely applauded. What a contrast when a Latin American country nationalizes part of the economy! Then the capitalists reacted with indignation. Our nationalizations insisted Mr. Enchauste want to serve the interests of the people; theirs are aimed against the people. The benefits from our nationalizations finance the struggle against illiteracy, the building of houses and healthcare. He also stressed the importance of growing collaboration and integration of the continent to achieve the goals of the social and economical revolution. The Cuban diplomat, Mr. Perera, dealt with the role of the socialist parties around the world. They must play their role in defending the interests of the working class. The financial crisis raises in the minds of a large layer of the public the irrationality of this economic system than cannot be reformed. He also indicated that we needed to think urgently about the future, not only of the economic system but of the whole of humanity. “In 2030 we will need two planets to be able to continue at this rate. Two thirds of the world still live in terrible conditions”. He noted how the banks were given vast amounts of financial help when much more important social projects are starved of any serious financing. Eric Toussaint explained that we cannot speak solely of a financial crisis. This is a crisis of the system itself. This system cannot be reformed but needs to be radically transformed. This is a truly international crisis, he repeated. His predictions for Latin America are bleak if the continent does not seriously consider the alternatives. The crisis will push down the prices of exports and will reduce incomes. He added that different banks in Latin America are US property. That’s why it is important to look at the example of President Chavez and to nationalize the banking sector as much as possible. Robert Bonillo, advisor of the Venezuelan Minister of Planning was also present, despite the intense election campaign. Proudly he explained that the GDP of Venezuela had grown by 4.6%, the minimum wage by 10% and that the revolution had succeeded in cutting unemployment from 20 to 7%. The nationalization of the oil company PDVSA, the steel and the cement industry, makes it possible to finance many social projects and stimulate the building of new homes. The profits of those companies are no longer devoured by just 2% of the population but are shared by the full 100%. He also mentioned the importance of the ideological struggle on a world scale. “Neoliberalism has had hegemony for a long time. For years in Venezuela we have pushed forward ideological elements to the people. The solution to this crisis depends on ideology”. After this debate the workshops started. The one on the ‘misiones’ attracted most of the people. Pol De Vos, gave a panoramic picture of the social reforms. This was completed with the concrete experience of Alessandra Moonens, a Belgian doctor who was active in the health system in Venezuela for six months. Another workshop dealt with the role of the workers in the revolution. An activist of the Christian union, Sebbe Vandeputte gave a first hand account of the struggle at Sidor and against the subcontractors. Kris Vandael, spokesperson of the socialist union at the Total refinery reported on the first official trade union mission in Venezuela. Georges Spriet and Wim Benda (former international observer of the presidential elections in 2006) gave a good picture of democracy at work in the country. During the breaks the many participants had the opportunity to visit the information stalls of for instance the Friends of Cuba, Iniciativa Cuba Socialista, Vrede and others. The Hands Off Venezuela stall sold 140 euros’ worth of material. The day ended with a meeting on the balance sheet of 10 years of revolution. Speakers were Robert Bonillo, Paul-Emile Dupret and Freddy Pulecio. During his speech Erik Demeester of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign insisted we needed to change the image we had on the relationship between Chavez and the people. The real engine of the revolution is the revolutionary mass of workers, peasants, urban poor and young people. It is their action, their active involvement in politics that pushes the revolution forward. Erik also warned of the fifth column of bureaucrats and reformists within the Bolivarian revolution who are a brake on the process and do not want it to be completed. Jesus Pino of the Revolutionary Front of Steelworkers was the special guest of the day of solidarity. He underlined the utter importance of workers’ participation, control and management in the nationalized industries. No company can be called a socialist company if there is no workers’ management. The experience in Venezuela teaches us that it is also a more efficient way of working. Decisions are taken by the workers themselves and not by a small number of managers. This increases production, efficiency and involves workers in the production process. Erik Demeester at the end thanked all the volunteers, the speakers and the interpreters. Thanks to a serious preparation and brilliant PowerPoint presentations a different and true picture was given of revolutionary Venezuela. A ‘hot’ Latina Fiesta concluded the day. Forward to a third day of solidarity! See more pictures here . ",NA,NA

			The Unfolding Revolution in Bolivia: A Report of the Bolivia Speaking Events in Montreal",2008-11-26T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ted and Rosa (La Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela)"," On November 12th and 13th, 2008, la Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela (SBQ/HOV), a revolutionary Latin American solidarity group in Montreal, invited Cynthia Cisneros Fajardo from Bolivia to speak about the revolutionary process that is unfolding in Bolivia. Cynthia Cisneros Fajardo is a Bolivian journalist and activist who has taken part in extensive community discussions on Bolivia's newly proposed constitution. She worked for years with prisoners in the San Pedro prison in La Paz, as well as with Indigenous people in urban and rural areas of Bolivia around the Constituent assembly. Alongside Venezuela, Bolivia is also at the forefront of revolutionary movements in Latin America and has been a source of inspiration for social movements around the world, particularly for the Indigenous movement in the whole continent of America or Abya Yala (Abya Yala means ""land in its full maturity"" and it is used by the Kuna people, the indigenous people in Colombia and Panama, to refer to the American continent before the arrival of Columbus). On the evening of Nov. 12th, Cynthia spoke at Cinéma du Parc after the screening of a documentary about Bolivia ("" La voie d'un peuple. Bolivie: une révolution par les urnes"" by Bruno Lorvào et Grégoire Schepard), organized by Masse Critique. Attended by approximately 100 people, Cynthia spoke about the constitutional process in Bolivia, the needs of the Constituent assembly, how Bolivians are represented in the New Constitution and the process of change in Bolivia. She also shared some statistics about the advances in social and economic development since the arrival in power of the MAS Party. There were a number of questions from the audience, who asked about concrete changes in relation to education and the economy. Some people asked questions about the participation and status of women in Bolivia, which Cynthia answered by pointing to the participation of women in the state organs, parliament and ministry. Others wanted to know which media to trust for accurate information about Bolivia. Cynthia suggested some Bolivian media sources, including popular media, alternative channels such as Canal 7 and Radio Patria Nueva and small community radio channels, which she said play an important role in disseminating information within Bolivia. Co-organized with the NDP McGill (New Democratic Party chapter at McGill University), Cynthia spoke in front of around 25 students about the political situation in Bolivia. She highlighted the political and economic achievements of the revolution, especially the fact that the global economic crisis hasn't hit Bolivia as bad as other countries because of the nationalization measures that have been taken by the MAS government. The inflation of food prices is controlled because some measures were taken against the capitalists, who used to hoard food in order to gain profit, especially in tough times like now. However, Cynthia also pointed out that the revolution in Bolivia is not without obstacles. She talked about the reactionary secessionist movement and also about the problem with the constitution which gives the opposition (which is the minority) a bigger voice. In the end, Cynthia made a very passionate call to everyone in the room that this revolution is not just a revolution for Indigenous people, that it is not just a revolution for the Bolivian masses, but that this is also a revolution for everyone in the room who considers themselves a good person, concerned about the well-being of others. On the evening of Nov. 13th, a cultural night was organized. In addition to a presentation by Cynthia Fajardo Cisneros, a host of revolutionary musicians (Camilo and Sebastian Mejia, Iqi Balam, and Palosanto) performed for a crowd of around 25 people. Action Creative also screened their documentary called ""Yacuyuyari: Memorias de agua, "" about the impacts of the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) on agricultural and water resources and customs of Indigenous communities. The highlight of the evening was the surprise visit of Stuart Myiow jr., Wolf Clan, Traditional Council representive of the Kahnawake Mohawk community. Stuart spoke about the importance of this meeting, symbolizing the unity of the Indigenous movement of the Abya Yala continent. He highlighted the struggle against the capitalist democracy (which he referred to as ""democrapitalism"") that imposes its democracy in the form of a band council, which is rejected by the people of the First Nations, and how this democracy is only a democracy for the corporations. He ended with a strong message that capitalism is a malady and a cancer to the world and that if it is not defeated it will kill our Mother Earth. This is similar to the messages that president Hugo Chavez often makes in his speeches: Socialismo o muerte! (Socialism or death!): That if capitalism is not smashed and replaced, it will kill all of us and the earth we are living. SBQ/HOV would like to thank to all the co-organizers of these three speaking events: Action Creative, Casa CAFI, NDP McGill, the Mexican Association Students (MAS) of Concordia University and Masse Critique.

Cynthia Cisneros Fajardo est une journaliste et militante bolivienne qui a participé dans de vastes discussions en Bolivie à propos de la nouvelle constitution. Elle a travaillé pendant des années avec les prisonniers de la prison de San Pedro à La Paz, ainsi qu'avec les peuples autochtones dans les zones urbaines et rurales de la Bolivie sur la question de l'Assemblée constituante. Comme le Venezuela, la Bolivie est aussi à l'avant-garde des mouvements révolutionnaires en Amérique latine et a été une source d'inspiration pour les mouvements sociaux dans le monde entier, en particulier pour le mouvement autochtone dans l'ensemble du continent de l'Amérique ou Abya Yala (Abya Yala signifie "" le pays dans sa pleine maturité"" et est utilisé par le peuple Kuna, les peuples autochtones en Colombie et au Panama, pour se référer au continent américain avant l'arrivée de Christophe Colomb). Le soir du 12 novembre, Cynthia a parlé au Cinéma du Parc après la projection d'un documentaire sur la Bolivie ("" La voie d'un peuple. Bolivie: une révolution par les urnes "" par Bruno et Grégoire Lorvào Schepard), organisée par Masse Critique. Devant à peu près 100 personnes, Cynthia a parlé du processus constitutionnel en Bolivie, des besoins de l'Assemblée constituante, de comment les Boliviens sont représentés dans la nouvelle Constitution et du processus de changement en Bolivie. Elle a également partagé des statistiques sur le développement social et économique depuis l'arrivée au pouvoir du parti MAS (Mouvement au Socialisme). Il y a eu pleins de questions de l'audience, par exemple sur les changements concrets en matière d'éducation et de l'économie. D'autres voulaient en savoir plus sur la participation et le statut des femmes en Bolivie. Cynthia a parlé de la participation des femmes dans les organes de l'Etat, du parlement et du ministère. Quelques membres de l'audience voulaient aussi savoir à quels médias faire confiance pour des informations précises sur la Bolivie. En réponse à la dernière question, Cynthia a suggéré certains médias boliviens, y compris les médias populaires, des canaux alternatifs tels que Canal 7 et la radio Patria Nueva de même que les petites chaînes de radio communautaires, qui dit-elle jouent un rôle important dans la diffusion de l'information au sein de la Bolivie. Co-organisé avec l'Université McGill, le NPD (Le chapitre du Nouveau parti démocratique à l'Université McGill), Cynthia a parlé devant près de 25 étudiants sur la situation politique en Bolivie. Elle a souligné les réalisations politiques et économiques de la révolution, en particulier le fait que la crise économique mondiale n'a pas touché la Bolivie aussi fortement qu'ailleurs, grâce aux nationalisations effectuées par le gouvernement du MAS. L'inflation des prix des produits alimentaires a été contrôlée parce que certaines mesures ont été prises contre les capitalistes, qui achetaient la nourriture afin de faire un profit dans les périodes difficiles. Mais Cynthia a aussi mentionné que la révolution en Bolivie n'est pas sans obstacles. Elle a parlé du mouvement séparatiste et aussi du problème de la constitution, qui donne à l'opposition (qui est la minorité) une plus grande voix. Vers la fin, Cynthia a fait un appel très passionné aux participantes et participants pour remarquer que cette révolution n'est pas seulement une révolution pour les peuples autochtones, ni pour les masses boliviennes; mais pour toutes celles et ceux qui se considèrent de bonnes personnes et qui se sentent concernéEs par le bien-être des autres. La soirée du 13 novembre, une soirée culturelle a été organisée. En plus de la présentation de Cynthia Fajardo Cisneros, des musiciens révolutionnaires (Camilo et Sebastian Mejia, Iqi Balam et Palosanto) ont joué pour une audience d'environ 25 personnes. Action Créative a aussi montré son documentaire ""Y acuyuyari: Memorias de agua, "" sur l'impact de l'accord de la Zone de libre-échange des Amériques (ZLEA) sur l'agriculture et sur les ressources et les coutûmes des communautés autochtones. La surprise de la soirée a été la visite de Stuart Myiow jr., du Clan Loup et représentant du Conseil Traditionnel de la communauté Mohawk de Kahnawake. Stuart a parlé de l'importance de cette réunion, qui symbolise l'unité du mouvement autochtone du continent Abya Yala. Il a fait lumière la lutte contre la démocratie capitaliste (qu'il a dénommé ""démocrapitalisme""), qui impose la démocratie sous la forme d'un conseil de bande lequel est rejeté par les peuples des Premières Nations, et que cette démocratie est seulement pour les corporations. Il a terminé avec un message important: le capitalisme est une maladie et un cancer dans le monde et que si il n'est pas détruit il tuera notre Mère Terre. Ceci est similaire aux messages que le président Hugo Chavez fait souvent dans ses discours: Socialismo o muerte! (Socialisme ou la mort!): Si le capitalisme n'est pas renversé et remplacé, il va tuer chacun d'entre nous et la terre dans laquelle nous vivons. Le SBQ/HOV aimerait remercier tous les co-organisateurs de ces événements: Action Créative, Casa CAFI, NDP McGill, l'Association mexicaine d'étudiants de l'université Concordia (MAS) et Masse Critique. By Ted and Rosa (La Société Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela) El 12 y 13 de Noviembre de 2008, la Sociedad Bolivariana de Quebec/Hands Off Venezuela (SBQ/HOV), un grupo revolucionario de solidaridad con América Latina, invitó Cynthia Cisneros Fajardo de Bolivia a tomar la palabra sobre el proceso revolucionario que se desarrolla en Bolivia. Cynthia Cisneros Fajardo es una periodista y militante boliviana que ha participado en importantes discusiones acerca de la nueva constitución en Bolivia. Ha trabajado durante años con prisioneros de la cárcel de San Pedro en La Paz, al igual que con los pueblos indígenas en zonas rurales y urbanas de Bolivia en lo que se refiere a la asamblea constituyente. Como Venezuela, Bolivia esta también en la vanguardia de los movimientos revolucionarios en América Latina y a sido una fuente de inspiración para los movimientos sociales en el mundo entero, en particular para el movimiento indígena en el continente americano o Abya Yala (Abya Yala significa ""La tierra en su plena madurez"" y es utilizado por el pueblo Kuna, pueblos originarios de Colombia y Panamá, para referirse al continente americano antes de la llegada de Cristobal Colón. La noche del 12 de Noviembre Cynthia habló en el Cinéma du Parc después de la presentación de un documental acerca de Bolivia ( ""La Voz de un pueblo. Bolivia : una revolución por las urnas"" de Bruno Lorvào y Grégoire Schepard), organizado por Masse Critique. Aproximadamente 100 personas asistieron, Cynthia hablo acerca del proceso constitucional en Bolivia, las necesidades de la asamblea constituyente, de como los bolivianos están representados en la nueva constitución y del proceso de cambio en Bolivia; también mostró algunas estadísticas que confirmaban los avances en el campo social y de desarrollo económico desde la llegada al poder del MAS. Miembros de la audiencia preguntaron acerca de los cambios concretos en relación a la educación y la economía. Algunos preguntaron sobre la participación y el status de la mujer en Bolivia, a lo cual Cynthia respondió señalando la participación de la mujer en los órganos del estado, parlamento y ministerios. Otras personas querían saber en cuales medio se podía confiar para poder tener una información precisa sobre Bolivia, Cynthia sugirió algunas fuentes de medios bolivianos, incluyendo fuentes populares como Canal 7, Radio Patria Nueva y canales de radio de pequeñas comunidades, los cuales juegan un papel importante en la difusión de la información en el país. Organizado conjuntamente con NPD McGill (Nuevo Partido Democrático capitulo McGill), Cynthia habló frente a cerca de 25 estudiantes sobre la situación política en Bolivia, recalco los logros económicos y políticos de la revolución, en especial, el hecho de que la crisis económica mundial no ha tocado a Bolivia tan fuerte como a otros países a causa de las medidas de nacionalización que han sido tomadas por el gobierno del MAS (Movimiento Al Socialismo). La inflación de los precios de productos alimenticios esta controlada debido a las medidas que fueron tomadas contra los capitalistas, quienes solian comprar alimentos y almacenarlos con el fin de aprovecharse de la población en tiempos dificiles. Sin embargo, Cynthia también señalo que la revolución en Bolivia no se encuentra libre de obstáculos, mencionando que existe un movimiento separatista y un problema con la constitución, que le da mucho poder a la oposición, siendo esta una minoría. Al final de la charla, Cynthia hizo un llamado apasionante a cada uno de los presentes para que tengan en cuenta que la revolución no es solo una revolución para los pueblos indígenas ni para las masas bolivianas sino que es una revolución para todos aquellos quienes se consideran buenas personas y se preocupan por el beneficio de los demás. El 13 de noviembre en la noche hubo un evento cultural y después de la presentación de Cynthia Fajardo Cisneros, un puñado de artistas revolucionarios (Camilo y Sebastian Mejia, iQi Balam y Palosanto) se presentaron frente a una audiencia de mas o menos 25 personas. De igual manera, Action Créative proyectó su documental "" Yacuyuyari: Memorias de agua "" centrado en los impactos del Área de Libre Comercio De Las Americas (ALCA) en la agricultura, el agua como recurso y las costumbres de las comunidades indígenas. La sorpresa de la noche fue la visita de Stuart Myiow Jr del Clan Lobo y representante del Consejo tradicional de la comunidad Mohawk de Kahnawake, Stuart habló sobre la importancia de la reunión, la que simboliza la unión de los movimientos indígenas del continente Abya Yala. Igualmente resaltó la lucha contra la democracia capitalista (a la que se refirió como ""democrapitalism"") que impone su democracia en territorio indígena bajo la forma de consejos de banda. Este modelo -dijo Stuart- es rechazado por las comunidades indígenas, y consideran que esta democracia es solo para las corporaciones. Finalizó su discurso diciendo que el capitalismo es una epidemia, un cancer para el planeta y que si no lo derrotamos, acabara con nuestra Madre Naturaleza. Este mensaje es similar al que comúnmente el presidente Hugo Chavez presenta en sus discursos : Socialismo o muerte!; que si el capitalismo no es destruido y desplazado, acabara con nosotros y con el planeta entero. La SBQ/HOV quisiera agradecer a todos los co-organizadores de estos tres eventos: Action Créative, la Casa CAFI, NDP McGill, la Asociación de Estudiantes Mexicanos (MAS) de la Universidad Concordia y Masse Critique.

													Saeb Karimi","Hello dear brothers and sisters I just read the article about the Human Rights Watch report on Venezuela. The word “Human Rights” has been one of the main pretexts used by imperialism to attack the independent government that do not comply with their demands. Bush and US government are the most dangerous and vicious war criminals. They have many secret dungeons all over the world, and just a few of them are known by the public such as Guantanamo bay. They have violated the sovereignty of countries like Vietnam, Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan for more profits. I am writing to condemn these kind of US-backed propaganda against Bolivarian Revolution. These attacks indicate the growing influence of Bolivarian Revolution and president Hugo Chavez not only in Venezuela, but also in the whole region and even in all the undeveloped countries. This growing influence has terrified the US government.

The Polo Democratico UK and Colombia Solidarity Campaign organised the event at short notice, and were joined by the Solidarity Federation, the Latin American Workers Association and Hands Off Venezuela.

			Palestinian support for revolution in Venezuela",2008-10-10T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Editorial Board Arabic Hands off Venezuela website"," On Thursday, 23 November 2006, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine organised a festival of solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution called “Festival of the Popular Front in Solidarity with Venezuela and its revolutionary leader Chavez” at the cultural centre of Almishal, in Gaza. During the activity comrade Ghazi Surani made a very important speech and statement. We publish here the information of this activity of solidarity and the full text of the speech by Comrade Ghazi Surani and we apologise to the comrades of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and to all our readers for this delay in the publication of this article. We had technical problems that prevented us from accessing one of our e-mail accounts and so we were unable to read this important correspondence. We also renew our commitment and our constant readiness to publish the news of all the activities of solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution organized by left-wing parties and movements and workers’ and youth organisations in the Arab world. “From Palestine, the front line of the conflict with the Zionist enemy, we send our comradely greetings and sincere internationalist solidarity to the revolutionary leadership of Venezuela and its leader, comrade Hugo Chavez. During the days before his registration for the candidacy for the presidency, Chavez said he felt confident and proud that the ""Bolivarian hurricane"" will start. He has set a target for himself: to achieve ten million votes to ensure victory. “When Chavez stood up in the United Nations General Assembly on 15/9/2005 to defy the USA and its allies, he said: ‘In only seven years of Bolivarian Revolution, the people of Venezuela can today be proud because of the social and economic achievements.’ “In order to help the poor masses with food and medicine 17 million Venezuelans – almost 70 percent of the population – receive healthcare. ‘They deliver more than 1,700,000 tons of food for more than 12 million people at reduced prices supported by the state, almost half of the people, a million of them receive that food completely free’.” “These achievements are thanks to the revolutionary leadership in Venezuela because the economic approach adopted by the Chavez government, since reaching power in the late nineties, is to have the economy at the service of the people, rather than have the people at the service of the economy. This is the fundamental idea towards the abolition of the capitalist exploitation and it is the first step to socialism. “This revolutionary approach would demolish the liberal capitalist model and will be a blow to the imperialist interests. Chavez and his government are well aware of this fact and realise that the fate of the country depends on the resistance against pressures, and Chavez and his comrades are men of principle as Castro once said. They are like the real gold, so it is not surprising that the revolution is advancing in Venezuela. Rather than collapsing, Chavez won, Bolivar held up, and the economy resisted. And the masses’ support for the Revolution increased. “The credibility of Chavez and his revolutionary acts against the interests of imperialism and Zionism, in the service of the interests of the masses of poor workers and peasants, was undoubtedly one of the factors that have helped Chavez and his party to achieve a resounding victory in the referendum on 15/8/2004. And he will win the next presidential elections in December 2007-2013. In the meantime U.S. imperialism continues to exercise pressure on Latin American governments to help it to isolate the Venezuelan revolution, which is an example for the angry masses on the continent. Against the imperialist attacks, poor people stand with their revolutionary leadership. The true allies of the people of Venezuela are the oppressed workers and peasants of Latin America. They are always the only forces which can be relied upon to defend the Venezuelan revolution and any other revolution in this world. We in Palestine affirm our internationalist solidarity with Chavez and the revolution in Venezuela, which will continue announcing the collapse of imperialism and its stooges in South America and become a basis and an ally for the Palestinian revolution and the left-wing revolutionary movements in all the countries of the Third World. “The defence of the Venezuelan revolution does not come through diplomacy, but through a revolutionary and internationalist policy. Its aim is the spreading of the revolution across Latin America and beyond, in Africa, Asia and all countries of the Arab world. “The Venezuelan revolution is a national democratic revolution on the path to socialist revolution, and in this context, the so-called ""democratic"" bourgeoisie is only a fraud hiding behind it the dictatorship of capital with the leadership of the right-wing coalition led by bureaucratic agents and stooges of imperialism. “Only the revolutionary movement of the masses has prevented the counter-revolution from achieving victory. Experience has shown that the only solid base that supports the revolution is the poor masses, especially the working class and peasants. “Our sincere message from ourselves, the PFLP, to the leadership and workers in Venezuela is: trust only in your own forces! Trust only in the revolutionary movement of the masses! This is the only force that can sweep aside all obstacles and defeat counter-revolution and begin to take power in their hands. This is the only guarantee for victory. In this way, what is needed is a revolutionary programme based on scientific grounds, and there is no theory that can achieve this apart from Marxism and its party, the party of workers and poor peasants. “The struggle for revolutionary democracy cannot win unless it becomes a struggle against the dictatorship of capital and its class collaboration. Therefore, in order to win the struggle for democracy, it should lead directly to the struggle for the seizure of power by the workers and poor peasants and for socialism. There is no ‘third way’. “The future of the Bolivarian revolution will be determined, in the final analysis, by the degree of its spreading to the rest of Latin America and beyond. Che Guevara understood very much this idea when he said that the Cuban revolution could be protected only by creating ""one Vietnam, two Vietnams or three or more"". Here we see that Venezuela and other Latin American countries are on the path to achieve the Guevarian dream. “The revolutionary movement has since been extended to other countries as we have seen with the election of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Lula in Brazil, and in Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Nepal and many countries of Asia, Africa. The Arab countries are not far from this revolutionary wave. “The Bolivarian Movement will win, and move forward beyond the limits of bourgeois democratic revolution, and achieve socialist revolution. We in the PFLP reaffirm our confidence in the revolutionary leadership and in comrade President Chavez towards further progress on the path of socialist revolution in South America, which will be a beacon and a leadership and example for our comrades in the Popular Front and for all the Arab left-wing revolutionary fighters for national liberation, democracy and socialism in our country. “Be aware that any blow to the Venezuelan revolution is a blow to all of us and that the steadfastness of the revolution and its victory is a victory for all the oppressed and all those who are struggling for freedom, progress and socialism. “Long live the socialist revolution in Venezuela, which is invading all of Latin America today and threatens the interests of imperialism and the Zionist presence in our country. “Long live the internationalist solidarity against the Zionist imperialist alliance in our country. The red flags of freedom and socialism will fly in our country the same manner that it is flying in Venezuela today. Guevara is not dead and will come back... Open the doors... Put up masts for the flags of the left that are flying high in Venezuela and Latin America, Asia and Africa announcing the beginning of the steps towards the defeat of imperialism and its Zionist ally and all the reactionary forces in our country. “Long live the Popular Front, one of the left vanguards in the Arab world. “Long live the socialist revolution in Latin America, the vanguard of internationalism in this era.” Source: Arabic Hands Off Venezuela ",NA,NA

Sussex holds a long standing anti-capitalist tradition which was reflected the enthusiasm of students for the HOV stall. Throughout the day, comrades discussed and debated the progress of the Revolution with a wide variety of people, from supporters of the Revolution, to those unfamiliar but sympathetic; from experienced activists to sprightly freshers. What united them all was the belief that an alternative to capitalism is possible. All in all we collected 64 contacts, as well as selling some HOV materials. We will be holding our first meeting on Monday 6th October - where Alan Woods will launch his new book 'Reformism or Revolution' - in optimism that the success of the freshers fair can be continued.

There was a great deal of interest in the university’s HOV society and the programme of events that the comrades have lined up. The society managed to sign up 13 members and collected more than 50 contact details as well as selling books, pamphlets and HOV magazines. An intense week of campaigning ended with a screening of the DVD ‘No Volveran!’ - the story of the workers of Sanitarios Maracay touched everyone present and even prompted two people to sign up to the HOV society on the spot. In the following weeks we intend to have a meeting here against the fascist coup attempt in Bolivia on the 8th October, and discussions on the case for socialism both in Venezuela and internationally.

													HOV Greece"," On Friday, September 26, the Greek section of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign hosted an open debate about the recent events in Venezuela and Bolivia and the future of the revolution in Latin America. The discussion took place at the Immigrant Club, with about 80 supporters of the campaign present, including workers, students and left wing party activists. The main speakers were the ambassador of Venezuela in Athens, Rodriguez Chavez, and member of the HOV campaign Stamatis Karagianopoulos. Stamatis started by going into the recent events, underlining that the best way to support the revolution against the coup, which the oligarchy and imperialism are planning, is through the victory of the revolution in all of Latin America. He explained that solidarity action for Venezuela and Bolivia is one of the most important and urgent matters for the working class of the entire world, because, as he emphasized, ""the events in these countries are not national issues, but they are linked to the future of socialism in the whole world."" Finishing his speech Stamatis Karagianopoulos urged the supporters of the campaign to convey to their periphery not only the message of solidarity but also the political lessons we gain from the movement of the working class in these countries: the need for nationalization, workers' control and the replacement of the bureaucratic bourgeois state with workers' councils. The ambassador of Venezuela gave a historical overview of past revolutionary struggles of Venezuela against colonization and he referred to the cultural differences of the people in Latin America. At the end of his speech he thanked the campaign for its rich and important activity in support of Venezuela and urged the supporters to keep on supporting the aims of the Bolivarian revolution. This was followed by questions and a discussion opened up about important political issues, for example on the policies of Chavez and Morales. Are these the correct policies and the real essence of socialism? At the end of the discussion Ilias Kirousis announced a programme of activities of the campaign, which includes the hosting of open discussions in the faculties of Biology in Athens and Law in Komotini. All those present showed an interest in being more active in the campaign. ",NA,NA

			“Justice now! Free the five!” - Report of vigil for Cuban Five in London",2008-10-08T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Manuel Reichetseder - HOV London"," Yesterday saw an impressive show of solidarity for the Miami Five in front of the US embassy at London's Grosvenor Square. About five hundred people turned up to the annual candlelit vigil organised by the Cuba Solidarity Campaign in Britain. Hands Off Venezuela joined the protest, which marked the 10th anniversary of the arrest of these five courageous men. 10 years ago these five Cubans were arrested in the United States not because of terrorism, but because of opposing terrorism. Since the existence of the Cuban Revolution the campaign of terror on the part of the Miami based counter-revolutionary Cuban-American mafia has not stopped. The mafia planned and performed acts of sabotage, assassinations, bomb attacks and terrorist activities, which had its unfortunate highlight in an attack on a Cuban airliner in Barbados, in which 73 people lost their lives. In total more than 3,000 Cubans have died over the last 50 years as a consequence of US-backed terrorism, aimed at the restoration of capitalism and imperialist rule on the island. The five Cubans Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González, and René González, infiltrated the extreme right wing of the Cuban-American mafia in Miami in order to prevent other terrorist attacks from happening. On September 12th, 1998, they were arrested by the US government under false accusations. Since then they have been imprisoned in a cruel and unjust manner. René González and Gerardo Hernández have not been allowed to receive visits from their wives for 8 and 10 years respectively, because they have been denied visas to visit their husbands. Although there had been solid arguments in favour of their innocence, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has just recently ended their appeal to review the case and it upheld the convictions against all five Cuban fighters. As the sun set yesterday more and more people gathered in front of the US embassy listening to fourteen speakers, including Tony Woodley (joint general secretary of Unite, UK's largest union), Norma Stephenson (UNISON president), Rob Miller (director of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign), and many other trade unionists and social activists. In total 25 trade unions are affiliated to the Cuba Solidarity Campaign in Britain, which represent 95% of workers organised in unions. Many of the speakers said they had the honour to speak directly to the Miami Five, and since then have never stopped in campaigning for their release. Earlier in the day a high level delegation handed in a petition with over 14,000 signatures to the US Embassy calling for visiting rights for the wives of five Cuban nationals and asking for justice for the men. A very moving moment was when Olga Salanueva and Adriana Pérez, the two wives who have been denied visas to visit their husbands since the frame-up trial, came on the stage. A message they had prepared was read out to the crowd: The two women had already addressed a fringe meeting at this year's Labour Party conference in September to mark the 10th year of their husbands' arrests. With almost 350 people attending, including trade union leaders, MPs and members of the Labour Party national executive committee, it was one of the largest fringe meetings of the entire conference. Gerry Fernandez, international director of the United Steel Workers, came over from the US especially for the Miami Five solidarity events in Britain. He pointed out that the ""US government said the Miami Five are a threat to the security of the US, but it is Wall Street which is a threat to our security"". Referring to the anthem he closed his speech with ""we are the land of the free"" - but you couldn't miss hearing the sarcastic tone. The moderator thanked Gerry and said that his visit is also a good indication of the improving relations of British unions with the unions across the Atlantic. Afterwards a letter of one of the imprisoned, Gerardo Hernández, was read out. He thanked everybody who was involved in tireless campaigning for their release and that he can count on our solidarity in the future: The letter continues: Then the crowd started to shout for a few minutes: ""Justice now! Free the five!"" We will definitely not tire of fighting for justice and to broaden the support for the release of the Miami Five. For more information visit Cuba Solidarity Campaign . ",NA,NA

			Hands off Venezuela at the ESF",2008-09-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV Sweden"," Last week the European Social Forum was held in Malmö, Sweden. For once Latin America was a main feature. Hands off Venezuela was there with activists from Sweden, Denmark, Great Britain, Poland, Russia as well as sympathisers from Slovakia and Hungary. We had proposed a seminar about building solidarity with Venezuelan revolution. Unfortunately, we had not been included in the program. What was included, on Wednesday 17 th , was a screening of the documentary No Volveran - the Venezuelan revolution today presented by one of the directors, Will Roche. The movie was screened at the Cinema Spegeln as part of the ESF cultural program. The screening was just before the opening ceremony. This had the effect that some in audience had to go directly to the ceremony immediately after the film and could not stay for the discussion afterwards. The people that remained listened to Will as he described how he and Melaine McDonald went to Venezuela and got enthused by the revolution. This inspiration was captured on the film in which different revolutionary activists from Venezuela describe how they are fighting for socialism today. One of the main themes of the documentary is the struggle for workers' control as part of the Bolivarian revolution. We were also able to have a meeting on Thursday 18th about the recent developments in Bolivia and Venezuela. In Bolivia the rightwing has attacked peasants that support Evo Morales and in Venezuela it has recently been discovered that high-ranking officers had plans to kill President Chavez. As soon as it was confirmed that we had a meeting room, at the very last minute, we called our friends from the Bolivian solidarity movement in Sweden and asked if they where able to come to the meeting. We were very pleased when we heard that three speakers from Bolivia where able to speak at the meeting. One of the speakers was Juan Carlos Valderas a psychologist that works with an NGO and education in Bolivia. All of the speakers were in Sweden for the ESF and had time for our meeting. We had also the pleasure to welcome Néstor Francia from Venezuela, a well-known journalist from Venezuela who has been politically active all his live. The speakers described how the oligarchy in Venezuela and Bolivia is acting against any progressive development. One of the speakers was a young woman called Vivianne who is active in Santa Cruz. There, the right wing has organised armed gangs which are harassing leftwing activist and people who support the government. After the speakers, Martin Lööf from the Swedish HOV coordinating committee spoke about the fact that the oligarchy in both countries has proven that it will not respect the democratic will of the majority. Now it is time for workers and peasant to complete the revolution once and for all. Martin also spoke about the need to face the fascist gangs in Bolivia and how this could not be done just with unarmed groups of peasants like the ones that were massacred in Pando. He explained how President Chavez in Venezuela has warned that an imperialist intervention will be faced with a people in arms. Both Chavez and Evo Morales have spoken about socialism as the way forward. Wojtek Figel from the Polish HOV spoke about how the revolution in Latin America is an inspiration to workers and youth but a nightmare for the establishment. Wojtek was recently interviewed by Polish TV, but the only thing that was screened was when he said that Chavez is listening to the people. Polish TV didn't want to hear when he said that Polish politicians should also listen to the people. There was a lively discussion with Important contributions by members of the audience from Slovakia, Russia, Argentina and other countries. During the ESF there was an import meeting between Hands Off Venezuela and leading members of the Hungarian Venezuelan Solidarity Association. They had earlier applied to join HOV. This meeting was just to confirm this and discuss eventual details. They will keep their name but will add HOV to it in their publications. This is an important development for the campaign. This is a group that had organised a Venezuela solidarity weekend earlier this year with 200 people in attendance, amongst them international guests. This shows how youth and labour activists are attracted both to Latin America but also to HOV on an international scale. On Friday 19 th in the evening we organised a second meeting on the topic of Bolivia and Venezuela, against the coup threats in both countries. The main speaker was Jorge Martin. This meeting was co-organised with Kvarnby Folkhögskola, a school that is closely related to the Swedish Left Party. We were able to hold the meeting there thanks to help from members of the Left Party and because the school sees us as a campaign that is close to their aims. There were around 60 participants at this meeting, which was remarkable because the meeting was planned during the ESF, was not advertised in all the official programmes and it took place at venue outside the ESF area. The majority of those who attended were people that we had met during the ESF, who saw that we had something to say and wanted to hear more. In the audience there were activist, as well as important members of the labour movement from different countries. A large part of the audience was from Russia and Eastern Europe. On Saturday we participated in the final demonstration and had a stall at the beginning and the end. We also had a banner in the international block. Many people came to us explaining how pleased they were about the campaign and wanting to know more about it. During the whole ESF we had a stall in the Latin-American area which HOV activists also helped to run. We wanted to actively help out and work for the benefit of all. We would like to thank the organisers of this area, which was a really good place to be. We collected names of people interested in HOV from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, France, Greece, Kenya and many more countries. We have spoken with members of different solidarity organisation who work with Cuba, El Salvador, Bolivia and Venezuela and who want more cooperation. One of the few complaints was that we didn't have more time to discuss how we are going to build the campaign in Sweden and to hear more about the activities from HOV in the different countries that the campaign is active in. We sold a lot of material so we now have the resources to organise a second speaking tour. This time it will be an activist from the PSUV youth organisation. We hope that he will be able to visit Spain, Sweden, Finland and Norway. On the 29th of November we will organise the second national HOV conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The main topics will be Venezuela after the local elections, Bolivia today and Cuba 50 years since the revolution. The activists of the HOV from different countries were very pleased to meet each other and to see how we are having an impact with our work. This ESF was an important development for the campaign that will strengthen the work of HOV in Sweden and internationally. Hands off Venezuela - Sweden ",NA,NA

													HOV Spain"," About 100 people gathered on Monday, September 22, in front of the Bolivian embassy in Madrid, Spain, to show their opposition to the ongoing coup against the government of Evo Morales. They also denounced the assassination and disappearance of dozens of peasants by the fascist groups that are promoted by imperialism and the oligarchy. The solidarity rally had been called by a number of organisations, including Hands off Venezuela. Amongst the slogans shouted were “Alerta que camina, la espada de Bolívar por América Latina” and “Hands Off Bolivia and Venezuela”. At the end of the rally the Bolivian ambassador, María del Carmen Almendras Camargo addressed those present, thanking them for their solidarity. She was given a copy of the statement by a comrade from Hands Off Venezuela and met briefly with the organisers after the rally. This successful rally followed the one that took place in Barcelona on Friday, September 19th, which Hands Off Venezuela also helped to organise. Monica Vargas, in the name of the organisers, read a solidarity message denouncing the genocidal character of the Bolivian oligarchy. She said that the oligarchy is prepared to use all means at their disposal, including the killing of unarmed peasants in Pando, in order to preserve its privileges. It is the same oligarchy that supported the military dictatorships in the past and then the corrupt neo-liberal governments, which is now, with the support of the United States, arming the fascist gangs of the Union Juvenil Cruceñista, attacking the democratically elected government of Evo Morales, and the Bolivian people in general. The Bolivian ambassador, who had come from Madrid to attend the rally, received the letter of support and thanked all those present for their support in the name of the people and the government of Bolivia.

													HOV Belgium"," Some one hundred people gathered in front of the US embassy in Brussels last Friday. The immediate reason for this protest was the central role played by the US in the recent ""civic bosses' coup"" against the left government of Bolivia. The recent discovery of a new military plot in Venezuela to overthrow the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was also the target of our anger. But more generally it was also an action in support of the revolutions in both countries. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Brussels took the initiative ten days ago to organise a meeting on Bolivia, which was attended by thirty people. At the meeting a decision was taken to call for a protest in front of the US embassy together with other groups. A Belgian solidarity committee was launched. Apart from the many Latinos and left wing activists present, a whole group of twenty students from the French speaking university ULB was present. The day before a group of HOV activists had gone to the campus to distribute leaflets. To their surprise the leaflet was visible on the walls of different parts of the university! A group of students had spontaneously taken the initiative to organize the propaganda. The local action committee in solidarity with ""people without papers"", which had just organized a mass demonstration, and the local branch of ATTAC were also involved. The successful action ended with two militant speeches. Erik Demeester of the HOV campaign explained how the right-wing on Bolivia had tried to violently force through a coup. Temporarily the danger has receded but Evo Morales has proposed a new round of negotiations with the right wing opposition. The masses do not trust those negotiations and have reacted with mass mobilizations and have asked for weapons to defend themselves against the violent attacks of the extreme right-wing militias. The oligarchy of Bolivia and Venezuela will never reconcile themselves with those left-wing governments. They will not rest and they will use every means at their disposal until the governments are overthrown. Marcelo Estrada, member of the Bolivian MAS, spoke after Erik. Interestingly, he explained to the audience that the new negotiations are a trick used by the right wing to gain time and regroup its forces. He said that the opposition was fascist and racist and that it was not afraid of perpetrating mass murders like that of the peasants in the department of Pando. He also criticized the Bolivian justice system for wanting to free the prefect of Pando whom he consider to be the brain behind the mass murder. His speech was interrupted – in a friendly way – with the slogan ""El pueblo armado, jamas sera aplastado"" (The armed people will never be crushed). At the end, Marcelo thanked everyone for their solidarity and for the successful action. See more pictures at Picasa . ",NA,NA

													HOV Belgium"," ""El Frente Socialista de Trabajadores Petroleros da la bienvenida a la delegacion sindical petroquimica de Amberes."" (The socialist front of oil workers welcomes the Union delegation of the petrochemical industry of Antwerp). Those words were written on a big banner at the entrance of the social club of the oil workers of the refinery in Puerto La Cruz. Special guests of the Frente Socialista were Kris Vandael spokesperson of the socialist union ABVV at the Total refinery in Antwerp, Ronny Le Blon (full time official of the Antwerp Union and former spokesperson of ABVV Total), Freddy Pulecio (Colombian trade unionist of the USO oil workers' union and living in exile in Belgium) and Erik Demeester of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Our visit to the refinery in Puerto La Cruz was the final point of an intense tour of ten days through the world of unions active in the new PDVSA (the nationalized oil company) and Pequiven (the public petrochemical industry). The tour included visits to a wide range of oil and petrochemical installations, instructive discussions with trade unionists, meetings on the shop floor with oil workers, gatherings with different managers (revolutionary and not), travelling people's assemblies with the spokespersons of the community councils and student leaders, short cultural moments and meetings with a great number of socialist activists (most of them from the PSUV) of the new revolutionary Venezuela. Our trip ran at high speed from Caracas to the steamy city of Maracaibo, then to the peninsula of Paraguana, later to Valencia back to Caracas and then again to Maturin/Monagas and finally Puerto La Cruz in the state of Anzoategui. Due to lack of time we had to cancel the visit to the Orinoco belt. During our visit we came across a picket line of striking General Motors workers in Valencia and also a demonstration of council workers of Caracas in front of the Presidential Palace. The socialist union of Antwerp (AC Antwerpen Waasland) has a good record of international solidarity. Apart from its ‘core business' in defending the day to day interests of its 30,000 members, the branch supports different projects with unions in Latin America, for instance in Colombia, where it supports the union of land workers. A few years ago the union decided also to give support to the days of solidarity with the revolution in Venezuela and also to the ‘Hands Off Venezuela' campaign. At the most recent federal congress of the socialist trade union ABVV/FGTB the branch also presented a motion of support for the new unions in Venezuela. So it was no surprise when the union of petrochemical workers of Antwerp accepted the invitation of the unions in Venezuela organized in the ‘Foro Energetico de Trabajadores de America Latina y del Caribe' (see http://www.foroenergetico.org/ ) to come and visit their country and the Bolivarian revolution. This visit was really a breakthrough. Not only because it was the first official trade union from Belgium visiting the country, but more important is the fact that this union and its branch in Antwerp organizes the workers in the biggest petrochemical cluster in Europe, the second biggest in the world just behind Houston in Texas. It was a visit from a small country but from a very strategic sector. The importance of our visit did not go unnoticed in Venezuela. The press conferences, the reports in the local papers and television confirm this. Thanks to this trade union trip we got a good view of the revolution from within. In PDVSA we realized the strategic importance of the oil company for the revolution. For the first time indeed the oil profits have been used to finance a large panorama of social reforms - big and small, locally and nationally. Mision Ribas for instance is directly run and financed by PDVSA. This ‘Mision' guarantees free secondary education for young people as well as for adults. The oil company is also in charge of the new network of cheap food distribution established recently to combat the effects of artificial food scarcity and sabotage. Every district of PDVSA is also in charge of the development and financing of social projects. In the state (province) of Zulia, near the Maracaibo lake, Mision Barrio Adentro (free first medical aid) has revolutionized the health situation of the local population. Over a five-year period more than 46 million surgery visits have been made, with 6 million families visited by a doctor. It is estimated that some 40,000 lives have been saved thanks to this public health revolution. This is the revolution in practice. Mision Barrio Adentro has been made possible thanks to exchange of cheap oil for Cuban medical personnel and know-how. Due to the fact that the revolution has not been completed, PDVSA is still suffering from old bureaucratic habits, especially among certain layers of management. These have formally adapted themselves to the new regime but continue to function as before. Bureaucracy is of course much more than administrative labyrinths. The bureaucracy sabotages the social reforms, represses the democratic participation of the workers and the communities in decision-making. Sometimes it dares even to attack the unions. The bureaucracy holds on to its position in PDVSA because it claims to be technically irreplaceable. Often, but not always, bureaucracy goes hand in hand with corruption. Corruption starts with acquiring and distributing all kinds of small and big privileges. It is true, that access to the very appreciated jobs in PDVSA have been democratised and become more transparent. Nevertheless some managers dare to invoke urgency to bypass the new democratic procedure. So they can ‘sell' temporary jobs just like in the old times of the old PDVSA. Effective workers' control would be the best way of rooting out corruption. Putting an end to bureaucracy and corruption is one of the main challenges of the revolution over the coming months and years. This consciousness was clearly present in the people of the unions we met. In the Puerto La Cruz refinery, Maria, a local trade union leader, told us the following story. ""The workers saved the refinery during the bosses' lock-out in 2002-03. Not even for one day did they succeed in stopping, productions thanks to our initiative. For two years we kept effective control over the refinery. The power we had at that time we lost. But we want it back."" When we asked her if there were enough technically skilled or politically conscious workers to achieve this, Maria did not doubt a second. ""No, that's not the problem. We are waiting for the right political moment."" The problem of the bureaucrats in PDVSA who parade as real Chavistas is what is described as the Fifth Column (the Trojan Horse of the right wing). Real workers' control, as a step to effective workers' management by the workforce and the communities and the government, is the best cure against the cancer of the bureaucracy. One of the most remarkable moments of our visit to the revolution from within were the three meetings with the people from the neighbourhoods, especially with the spokespersons from the ‘community councils' (consejos comunales). The first thing that struck us was the dominant position of women elected in the community councils. And what kind of women! Referring to the record production of Miss Universe in Venezuela, the trade union leader Eudo commented: ""Yes our women are maybe known in the whole world for their beauty. But we know them better for their courage, their revolutionary commitment, their consciousness and their determination in the revolution. Nothing of this side of our women is told in the world"". Eudo of course is right. Women play a prominent role in the revolution. Especially in the neighbourhoods, the core of the popular movement, they are often the majority of the active participants. They told us how during the ‘coup d'état' in 2002 they were often getting their husbands out of the bars or from in front of the television to demonstrate on the streets. Today also they struggle to get PDVSA to establish gas lines directly to the popular neighbourhoods. Today they still have to carry those heavy gas bottles. During the people's assemblies the spokespersons of the community councils explained to us how they organize the neighbourhood, raise political consciousness and organize the struggle. From the many discussions with the oil workers we learned that there is a great desire for the unification of the fragmented trade union movement in PDVSA. Bruno Verlaeckt, president of the union AC Antwerpen-Waasland, often stressed during his speeches, as well in front of the trade Union leaders and with the workers on the shop floor, that our delegation supported the initiatives designed for the formation of a united left Union of oil workers. On paper, yes such a union already exists. From the oil workers of PDVSA, who form the backbone of the workers' movement in Venezuela, we would expect that they also have the strongest union. This is not yet the case. We met tireless fighters like Tony Leon of the Foro Energetico, who with many others work day and night for the unification of the movement. Others are also risking their lives like Luis from Anzoategui. A few weeks before our visit he was gunned down by mercenaries paid by the old corrupt trade union leaders, still active in the company. He survived the attack and was one of our guides. Despite the fact that the union movement does not possess its own school worth the name, we came across different local initiatives aimed at training the workers. At the INTEVEP research centre, the union activists explained how they were launching ‘socio-political training' amongst their colleagues. The project was called ‘Por los caminos de Marx' (In the footsteps of Marx). In Puerto La Cruz we received a booklet summarizing the initiatives related to political education. They succeeded in involving 4000 people. This was an initiative of the Frente Socialista de Trabajadores Petroleros. The subjects discussed covered the most recent political national and international news, the history of humanity from the point of view of class struggle, Marxism and Socialism of the 21 st century etc. In general we met oil workers who were very proud of how they had saved the company and run it themselves during the bosses' lockout of 2002-03 and how they had succeeded in freeing the company from the grip of the right wing and American imperialism. They were also quite proud to work for a company that is using its profits to finance social reforms and the revolution. To be able to play that much needed leading role in the revolution in the formation of a real left wing, democratic and united trade union federation has become an absolute priority. The Algemene Centrale Antwerpen-Waasland will now start a series of internal report back meetings with the activists of the branch and in the wider Union. Together with other groups the Hands Off Venezuela campaign is preparing also a new day of solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution on Saturday 15 th of November in Brussels.

The rally was organized by the Societé Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela in response to the US-backed coup plots uncovered last week in Bolivia and Venezuela. The protesters carried placards in English, French and Spanish with slogans such as ""Defend the Revolution from Santa Cruz to Caracas"" & ""Hands Off Bolivia"" and broke into enthusiastic chants of ""Solidarite! Québec avec Amerique Latin!"" (""Québec in Solidairty with Latin America!"") Dozens of fliers were handed out to interested passers-by. These outlined the American-backed coup plots & the subsequent violent attacks on Bolivian natives and peasants by reactionary opposition gangs. Several cars & city buses honked in support. Ricardo Astudillo & Ted Sprague of SBQ/HOV addressed the crowd in French & English. They explained how the US was trying to undermine the democratic mass movements that were restoring sovereignty to their countries and improving the lives of working people. Sprague mentioned that similar protests were taking place at American embassies & consulates across Canada and throughout the world. Laurent Barbot of Haiti Action Montreal also spoke, pointing out the consistent pattern of American intervention throughout the hemisphere to secure subservient governments, including the continuing presence in Haiti.

			Toronto Media Democracy Conference Denounces Corporate Media and Coup Plots in Bolivia and Venezuela",2008-09-23T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV Canada"," On Saturday September 20 th , approximately 80 people attended, ""Media Democracy - a conference on corporate control of the media."" This conference at Ryerson University in Toronto was held in conjunction with protests in Vancouver and Montreal as part of a Canada-wide day of action against coup plots in Bolivia and Venezuela. Given the title, the conference particularly focused on the role of the corporate media in promoting or justifying the attempt by US and allied imperialism to destabilize popular movements in Latin America. The conference begun with Key-note speaker Linda McQauig, a prominent journalists and author of such books as ""It's the crude, dude."" McQuaig gave a lively and entertaining speech which focused on how Canadian Media has a structural pro-corporate bias. For example, when ""The National,"" (the main news show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), discusses Canada's war in Afghanistan, all four of its panelists are pro-war, even though a significant majority of the Canadian population opposes the war. Through the day there were workshops on alternative popular forms of media, about the link between the struggles in Latin America and Africa, a workshop titled ""What is Socialism of the 21 st Century?"" and another one detailing recent conflicts in Latin America. Unfortunately, keynote speaker Eduardo Rothe, from the Venezuelan Ministry of Communications and Telesur, had to cancel at the last minute due to a car accident. Thankfully nobody was hurt. Eduardo apologized, explaining that while there have been many advances in the Bolivarian Revolution, there is still much work to be done on the quality of the roads! The workshop on Latin America was presented by Maria Paez from the Toronto Bolivarian Circle Louis Riel and Camilo Cahis from Hands Off Venezuela Canada. This workshop gave participants a chance to discuss the role of the corporate media in organizing the Venezuelan coup of 2002 and in downplaying the frankly fascist actions of the Bolivian oligarchy over the last few months. All the attendees at the conference were united in opposing the actions of the corporate media against working people in Latin America, Canada and worldwide. Mirna Quero de Peña, the Consul General of the Bolivarian republic of Venezuela in Toronto, gave the following welcome: ""I would like to extend a warm greeting to you all, especially to Louis Riel Bolivarian Circle and Hands Off Venezuela, organizers of this important Forum: ""Media and Democracy"", and at the same time I would like to thank them and you the participants in this event, for your solidarity with our Bolivarian Process, led by our Honourable President Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías."" In turn, HOV and the Bolivarian Circle would like to thank the Venezuelan Consul, Ryerson University Student Union (RSU), the Continuing Education Students Association at Ryerson (CESAR), Ryerson Social Work Student Union and the Canadian Media Guild for their help and assistance - without whom this successful conference would have been impossible. Also, many thanks go to the presenters, Linda McQuaig, Camilo Cahis, Maria Paez Victor, Luis Granados, Anita Krajnc, Karen Wirsig, Carmelle Wolfson, Alex Grant, Asad Ismi, Omme-Salmar Rahemtullah and Samira Amndan. Political Hip-hop artists Stolen From Africa also entertained the conference attendees over lunch and helped round out this conference that is an important building block for the Latin America solidarity movement. With increased coordination by activists across the country, the movement can only go from strength to strength. Photos by Peter Rzazewski ",NA,NA

													HOV Canada"," On Saturday, September 20th, forty individuals of all ages gathered outside the American Consulate in Vancouver, to protest the intervention of US Imperialism in Latin America. The gathering aimed to show solidarity with the workers and peasants of Bolivia and Venezuela, and to raise awareness about America's complete disregard for democracy and the well-being of the people in these countries. Placards read ""Defend Bolivia's democracy"", ""Solidarity with Bolivian workers and peasants"" and ""USA clean your own house"". Several passers-by, including public and tourist site-seeing bus drivers, honked in solidarity. The rally, which was organized by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, was advertised and attended by a number of activist groups, and included several informed and motivating speakers. Terry Engler, of the Vancouver and District Labour Council, emphasized the fact that the revolutions taking place in Venezuela and Bolivia are an inspiration to workers worldwide, proving that we can take on the capitalist system and that there is an alternative. Long-time Peruvian activist Alicia Barsalow stressed that this gathering must be just the beginning of what will become the most important movement against US imperialism, as Latin America is slotted to be their next battle ground. Adriana Paz, of the Canada Bolivia Solidarity Network, explained that the demands of the Bolivian people are simple demands for sovereignty – the right to determine their own fate. While Evo Morales' presidency has been reaffirmed with more than two-thirds of the vote in August's recall referendum, ""what other president can say that?"" asked Adriana. Mike Palecek spoke on behalf of Hands Off Venezuela, again drawing attention to the need for solidarity action as the US has effectively declared war on the people of Venezuela and Bolivia with the recently averted coup and assassination attempt in Venezuela, and the attempt to provoke a civil war in Bolivia's most resource-rich states.

Le rassemblement visait à faire preuve de solidarité avec les travailleurs et les paysans de la Bolivie et du Venezuela ainsi que sensibiliser le public au sujet du mépris étasunien pour la démocratie et le bien-être de la population dans ces pays. Nous pouvons lire sur les pancartes «Défendons la démocratie bolivienne"", ""Solidarité avec les travailleurs et les paysans boliviens"" et ""Etats-Unis mêlez-vous de vos affaires"". Plusieurs automobilistes y compris des chauffeurs du transport public et touristique ont fait entendre leurs klaxons en geste de solidarité. Ce rassemblement fut organisé par la campagne Hands Off Venezuela et plusieurs groupes activistes l'ont annoncé et y ont participé, parmi lesquels se trouvaient plusieurs orateurs informés. Terry Engler, du District de Vancouver du Conseil du Travail, a souligné le fait que les révolutions qui ont lieu au Venezuela et en Bolivie sont une source d'inspiration pour les travailleurs du monde entier. Ce qui démontre que nous pouvons vaincre le système capitaliste et qu'il existe une alternative. La militante péruvienne Alicia Barsalow souligné que cette réunion ne peut être que le début de ce qui deviendra le plus important mouvement contre l'impérialisme étasunien, tandis que l'Amérique latine est destinée à être leur prochain terrain de bataille. Adriana Paz, de la « Canada Bolivia Solidarity Network », a expliqué que les demandes du peuple bolivien sont de simples exigences de respect de la souveraineté - le droit de déterminer leur propre sort. Tandis que la présidence d'Evo Morales a été réaffirmée avec plus de deux-tiers des voix lors du référendum révocatoire en août dernier, « quel autre président peut en dire autant? » a demandé Adriana. Mike Palecek a parlé au nom de Hands Off Venezuela, attirant une nouvelle fois l'attention sur la nécessité d'une action de solidarité tandis que les États-Unis ont effectivement déclaré la guerre sur le peuple du Venezuela et de la Bolivie avec les tentatives de Coup d'État et d'assassinat au Venezuela, et la tentative de provoquer une guerre civile en Bolivie dans les départements les plus riches du pays. El sabado, 20 de septiembre, cuarenta individuos de todas las edades se reunieron en las afueras del Consulado Americano en Vancouver, para protestar la interverción imperialista de Estados Unidos en Latino América. Dicha manifestación se llevo a cabo con el fin de demostrar solidaridad con los trabajadores y campesinos de Bolivia y Venezuela, y para llamar conciencia sobre la indiferencia de EU con respecto a la democracia y bienestar de los ciudadanos de dichos países. Pancartas leían ""Defende la democracia de Bolivia"", ""Solidaridad con los trabajadores y campesínos de Bolivia"", y ""EU: limpia tu propia casa"". Varios viajantes, incluyendo conductores de autobuses públicos y turísticos tocaron sus bocinas en solidaridad. La manifestación, organizada por la campaña Hands Off Venezuela y anunciada por publicidad, fue asistida por numerosos grupos de activismo, y varios oradores motivacionales e informativos. Terry Engler, miembro del Consejo Laboral de Vancouver, resaltó el hecho de que las revoluciones desenvolviendose en Venezuela y Bolivia inspiran a trabajadores de todas partes del mundo, lo cual es prueba de que podemos vencer al sistema capitalista y de que existen alternativas. La veterana activista Peruana Alicia Barsalow declaró que esta manifestación fue solo el principio de lo que se convertirá en el movimiento mas importante en contra del imperialismo de EU, dado el caso que Latino America está destinada a ser su próximo campo de batalla. Adriana Paz, miembro de Bolivia Solidarity Network en Canadá, explicó que las demandas del pueblo de Bolivia eran simples peticiones de soberanía - el derecho a determinar su propio destino. Mientras tanto, la presidencia de Evo Morales a sido reafirmada con mas de dos-tercios de los votos en el pasado referendum de re-elección en Agosto. ""Que otro presidente puede decir esto?"" preguntó Adriana. Mike Palecek habló en nombre de Hands Off Venezuela, de nuevo recalcando la importancia de fomentar acción solidaria ya que EU ha eficazmente declarado guerra en contra los pueblos de Venezuela y Bolivia por medio de las recientes intentonas de golpe de estado y asesinación en Venezuela, y provocaciones de guerra civil en los estados mas ricos en recursos de Bolivia.

													Kenneth V. Georgetti - Canadian Labour Congress"," This is the Canadian Labour Congress's letter to the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressing 'deep concern regarding the current attack on democracy in Bolivia and other areas of Latin America'. September 15, 2008 Honourable David Emerson Minister of Foreign Affairs House of Commons Ottawa ON K1A 0A6 Dear Minister; On behalf of the more than 3.2 million working women and men represented by the Canadian Labour Congress, I write today to share our deep concern regarding the current attack on democracy in Bolivia and other areas of Latin America. Minister Emerson, we strongly encourage you to make clear to the international community that Canada, like other nations in the Americas will not recognize any authority in Bolivia other than the democratically-elected government of President Evo Morales and will not tolerate outside interference supporting secessionist factions in that beleaguered country. President Morales was democratically elected in 2005 and the Bolivian people again endorsed his leadership in a recent ""recall referendum"" which he won by a large majority of 67%. As I am sure you are aware, right-wing opposition groups have been conspiring to secede from Bolivia for months using violence and racist attacks to intimidate and terrorize the government and the majority of Bolivians that support it in an attempt to incite civil war or a coup d'etat. The strategy is clearly articulated by opposition leader Oscar Urenda: ""We will not be beaten, if we are talking about confrontations let's talk about confrontations, if we are going to talk about war, let there be war, but they will not impose anything on us. We are sufficiently strong to split off from the country, and if I have to take a stick, a sling, a gun, I will do it..."" Last week at least eight people were killed and dozens injured in violent protests carried out by right-wing youth groups and shock troops in conjunction with departmental governors and other opposition leaders. These gangs carried out a series of shootings, beatings, and ransacking of offices of the government, human rights and indigenous organizations. Natural gas exports to neighbouring Brazil and Argentina were temporarily cut off in order to sabotage the economy. The loss of human life was most costly in Panda where paramilitary gangs armed with machine guns massacred more than 60 campesinos leaving more than 100 unaccounted fro (disappeared). The victims were pursued, tortured, and murdered before the government declared a state of siege to end the rampage. These horrendous actions have elicited a huge response of outrage from civil society, social movements, the media and many governments from the hemisphere. Recent events suggest there is evidence for President Morales' assertion that the U.S. Embassy is supporting these violent, autonomy-seeking groups and ""conspiring against democracy"". As I am sure you know, President Morales has declared the US Ambassador Phillip Goldberg persona non-grata and requested his removal from the country after documenting months of Goldberg's meetings, exchanges, contacts and involvement with secessionist leaders. Washington's refusal to provide information about which groups it is funding through its AID program only adds to the suspicion and lack of trust between the two governments and gives the impression that the U.S. is contributing to efforts to destabilize and overthrow the Bolivian government. These events in Bolivia are reminiscent of the US-supported overthrow of democratically elected Chilean president Salvador Allende in Chile who also believed he could peacefully transform the formal democratic state he inherited. Events in Bolivia and rumors of coup d'etat being planned in Venezuela and against the fledgling government of Fernando Lugo in Paraguay is leading many to feel that Latin America now faces its most serious crisis since the re-introduction of democratic practice at the end of the last century. Minister Emerson, Canada must support the Bolivian people's right to be governed by a democratically-elected government. Canada must offer support to the government of President Morales, directly and through the Organization of American States to promote a dialogue and keep open legal and democratic channels for resolving differences and conflict. We cannot allow our hemisphere to succumb to past practices of military intervention and return to the dark days when the Pinochets of this world were in power. Many governments in the hemisphere have made their views known on the crisis. The current federal election should not stop Canada from expressing its views at the critical moment in our hemisphere. I look forward to seeing clear and concrete measures taken by Canada to help resolve this crisis of democracy in Bolivia and to prevent its escalation both inside Bolivia and to other countries in the region.

													Niklas Albin Svensson"," Yesterday John McDonnell MP explained why US imperialism is so concerned about developments in Bolivia and Venezuela: “What the US is terrified of is the prospect that socialism will catch light all across the Americas, so of course it has to go on the attack. But it is exactly for this moment that solidarity campaigns exist.” He explained that, “what is happening is not a personal attack on Morales or Chavez but an attack on the seeds of socialism that they are spreading.” The occasion was a solidarity meeting held at the office of the National Union of Journalists in London, which followed a very successful picket outside the US Embassy earlier in the afternoon. In fact, yesterday, hundreds of Latin American solidarity activists and supporters participated in the two activities that were organized by Hands Off Venezuela and other Latin American solidarity groups to express their solidarity with the people of Bolivia and Venezuela. The afternoon picket outside the U.S. Embassy saw the participation of up to 100 activists. For the workers and students in Britain, the revolutions in Venezuela and Bolivia are a massive inspiration. All the more worrying it is then when these revolutions are under threat from plotting generals and fascist gangs. Many speakers throughout the day, expressed the sentiment that an injury to one is an injury to all – a defeat of the Bolivian or Venezuelan revolution would be a blow also to the workers of the world. There were speakers from the campaigns, Hands Off Venezuela, Colombia Solidarity Campaign, Bolivia Solidarity Campaign, Global Women’s Strike and Movement of Ecuadorians in the UK. Following these speeches, others attending the protest, workers and students from Colombia, Bolivia, Britain and Chile took the opportunity to express their solidarity with their brothers and sisters in Venezuela and Bolivia and their opposition to U.S. imperialism. The evening meeting was packed with over 100 people in attendance. The first to speak was John McDonnell MP, as we have reported above. He recalled the experience of Chile in 1973, and stated that solidarity had to be expressed now. “As soon as I return to Parliament I will raise this issue on the floor of the Commons”, said John. He was followed by Beatriz Souviron, Bolivian ambassador, who gave an update on the recent massacre by fascist gangs in Bolivia. Felix Plasencia from the Venezuelan embassy also spoke, expressing his gratitude to the assembled meeting and the organizers for the support they had shown for the peoples of their countries. Alan Woods, founder of Hands Off Venezuela, was next to speak. He argued that the people had to be armed in order to defend the revolution from the coups and also cited the example of Chile 35 years ago. “The example of Chile and now of Bolivia shows that a revolutionary government can't trust the army to defend itself”, stated Alan. He went on to attack the oligarchy, the capitalists, landlords, who were the “main enemy to the Revolution”. He added that, “Only their overthrow would advance the cause.” Alan concluded by saying that if Hugo Chavez was here, he would say that the best way to help the Bolivian and Bolivarian revolutions is to fight for socialism in our own countries. Amancay Colque from the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign explained the details of the Bolivian massacre and how non-violence in the face of armed fascist gangs becomes absurd. She explained how in Pando state, the reactionary governor had hired mercenaries to machine-gun rural workers who support Morales. She also stated that the oligarchy is backed by companies in the US and European countries. “Our enemy is also imperialism”, she said. The meeting expressed its anger at the conduct of the prefects of Bolivia who had plotted with the U.S. Ambassador against the democratically elected president of the country. Many called for those responsible to be put on trial. The U.S. was repeatedly condemned for its meddling in the affairs of Bolivia and Venezuela and many speakers expressed their support for the expulsion of its ambassadors. In fact, whenever this call was issued during the meeting there was loud cheering. At both events, frequent mention was made of the blackout in the media. How can it be that when 30 poor peasants are massacred by fascist gangs, this news warrants no mention. And yet, mainstream media such as the BBC and CNN have no qualms in implying that Evo Morales is some kind of dictator. A great deal of anger was expressed at the media's silence on the coup attempt. Finally, the meeting resolved to maintain the solidarity activities and remain vigilant of any future developments in Latin America. Wednesday’s successful activities were a big step forward for the solidarity efforts in Britain. In the future we must be prepared to step this solidarity activity. Long live the revolutions in Venezuela and Bolivia! Down with U.S. imperialism! ",NA,NA

													Mauro Vanetti - HOV London"," On September 10th, 2008, The Coup d’État , the second part of Patricio Guzmán’s The Battle of Chile was screened in Bolívar Hall in London, as part of the Hands Off Venezuela Film Series organised in collaboration with the Venezuelan Embassy in the UK. Information about the first part, scrfeened on August 20 th , can be found in the previous report . The second part of the documentary is also extremely interesting and deals with the last weeks of the Allende government, from the first failed coup attempt (the Tanquetazo on June 29th) to September 11th, 1973, when Pinochet overthrew the democratic government and established the rule of the military Junta. This part opens with the dramatic account of the July coup. That coup was defeated in quite a similar way to April 2002 in Venezuela: the population immediately reacted and took to the streets, risking their lives in defence of the Revolution; the majority of the army vacillated, did not decide which side to back and remained in the barracks; a more or less “loyal” and “constitutionalist” minority of the army easily crushed the military uprising. Nevertheless, it was quite a serious matter: more than twenty people died in the confrontation. Politically, the coup was clearly the initiative of the Fascist group Fatherland and Freedom ( Patria y Libertad ) whose leaders sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy immediately after the defeat; at the same time, several mass media owned by members of the Chilean oligarchy showed warm support for the attempted putsch during the hours in which it seemed it might succeed, but tried to play down its seriousness after the event . The film shows an interesting face-to-face TV debate between a young Communist MP and a National Party MP. The Communist effectively exposes the political involvement of the National Party in the coup and quotes the enthusiastic declaration of right-wing radio stations on July 29 th , followed on the 30 th by allegations of the right-wing press that the coup (with all those victims!) was a hoax organised by the government! The right-wing MP in his reply fails to condemn the uprising using specious arguments and… refers to his own academic career as proof of his moral rectitude! Most of this second part of the film is devoted to explaining the debate that unfolded among the supporters of Allende. A more moderate wing on the one hand (the Communist Party, the Radical Party, the MAPU-OC, the Christian Left and Allende himself) promoted “dialogue” with the Christian Democracy, insisting on the “constitutional path” and trying to water down the most “controversial” aspects of the revolutionary process. On the other hand a more radical wing (most of the Socialist Party, the MAPU and, outside the Popular Unity coalition, the MIR) suggested that deepening the revolution, arming the workers and strengthening the organisations of people’s power was the only way forward to prevent another coup. In the aftermath of the coup, as an immediate retaliation, the Popular Unity proclaimed the occupation of several factories and the creation of the “industrial belts” under workers’ control. In the film, solemn workers’ meetings ratify the decision and reorganise production without the bosses, swearing oaths to defend Allende and fight against Fascism to the very end. And yet, under the pressure of the alleged need to reach a deal with the Christian Democracy, the moderate wing of the government would very soon start to propose handing some expropriated factories back to the previous owners – instead of consolidating an alternative planned economy based on workers’ control and democratic management from below, which would have been entirely possible given the level of consciousness and the admirable self-organisation of the working class. Several congresses and rallies over the summer, also shown in the film, defined the political lines of the various left-wing parties. The debate on which path to follow did not shake only the political parties, but also the trade unions and all popular organisations and communities. The documentary shows a trade union bureaucrat discussing with a large group of workers: among the rank and file, criticism of the “legalistic line”, preached by Allende and accepted by the trade union leadership, seems unanimous. The workers say that all important and viable factories must be permanently expropriated and used as armed strongholds for the revolution. The bureaucrat can only try to reply with vague references to the “Swiss capitalists” that own some of those factories and must not be enraged by nationalisations, in order to have Chile’s foreign debt renegotiated on more favourable conditions. The trade unionist does not seem to realise that foreign debt can also be repudiated by a revolutionary government. However, the workers from the floor clarify that they could not care less if the expropriated factories are the property “of Swiss bankers or Queen Elizabeth” . The argument between the workers and their “representative” continues, dealing with different points: the question of the level of consciousness of the masses, the question of bankrupt companies etc. It is self-evident from the footage that – whatever mistakes its leadership may have made – Chile 1973 was a true revolution, with the active involvement of the toiling masses at all levels. In the last summer of Allende, the masses start to develop a certain frustration in the face of the ambiguities of el compañero Presidente and quite often become critical towards his decisions. Another impressive scene: in a mass rally in support of the government, the slogan of Cerrar, cerrar / el Congreso Nacional ( Close, close / the Parliament ) starts being chanted by the crowd; Allende replies to his supporters that he cannot shut down the Parliament and the masses react with a chorus of whistles and boos – nevertheless, he promises to organise a national plebiscite on the issue (similar to the tactics used this year by Evo Morales). The hatred of the militant masses against Parliament was well deserved. After the Tanquetazo , everybody in Chile knew that another more serious coup was being prepared. The President needed the state of emergency to be declared in order to be legally entitled to take drastic measures against the reactionary plots in the armed forces, but Parliament, dominated by the Christian Democrats and the Nationalists, used its power of veto. In the meantime, the Chilean marines performed a series of spectacular actions in occupied factories, in poor neighbourhoods, even in a cemetery, searching for hidden weapons: pro-Allende masses could not arm themselves, yet the coup-makers were allowed to organise freely! Members of a poor community are interviewed and explain that they all support the government because its reforms for the first time gave them some dignity, and they are all in favour of arming but the government does not allow them to do so: “If they come with firearms, we cannot resist with our bare hands!” Everybody knew that they would come. From the gradualist and constitutionalist point of view of Salvador Allende, the only solution was pursuing a compromise with the Christian Democracy and the army. A new cabinet was formed, with the inclusion of the chiefs of the armed forces; the reactionary rector of the Catholic University of Santiago was also urged by Allende to join the cabinet, but he refused and the first round of talks with the Christian Democracy did not give concrete results. The political centre was clearly playing around to exhaust Allende and erode his credibility while the US-backed conspiracy progressed. A key loyal officer in the Navy, Arturo Araya, was killed on July 26 th , in the middle of Allende’s negotiations with the Christian Democracy. The same day a campaign of acts of terrorism and sabotage started to be waged throughout the country by the CIA-trained paramilitary group Patria y Libertad . Against the background of the hypocritical facial expressions of Chilean top officers attending Araya’s military funeral, the film-makers comment that this assassination was meant to remove an obstacle in the organisation of the plot. More chaos was needed. Once more, it was provided by the truck transporters. A massive lock-out of private transport companies threatened the national economy with complete paralysis. The government’s firm reaction when force was finally used to break the US-inspired siege was used by the opposition as another excuse to kick up a fuss. In the middle of August, the Catholic Church intervened. The Revolution was going too far and it was necessary to make an attempt to stop it with a typical trick: create an unnatural alliance with some “reasonable” bourgeois forces in whose name any element of social transformation would be reverted. Even if that had worked, it would probably have delayed but not prevented the coup – there are several historical examples. However, the attempt by the Church to force an alliance between the Popular Unity and the Christian Democracy failed. Patricio Aylwin, then leader of the Christian Democrats and later “critical advisor” of Pinochet and President of Chile in 1989, listed, as the pre-conditions for an agreement, completely unreasonable demands that infuriated the Left and were eventually refused by Allende himself. Significantly, one of the main demands was the restoration of the previous ownership in the nationalised factories of the industrial belts. August 22 nd is a key date. Due to the heavy pressure coming from the military, Carlos Pratt, the Minister of Defence, resigned and was replaced by General Augusto Pinochet (considered a respectful follower of the Constitution, also because of his role in the repression of the July coup) as Commander-in-Chief of the army (Pinochet was later to assassinate him in an act of international terrorism in Buenos Aires in 1974). On the same day, the Chamber of Deputies, with the joint votes of the Christian Democrats and the Right, passed a resolution denouncing the President of the Republic for breaking the constitutional order. This was basically an appeal to the army to intervene. One week before the final attack, a huge mass demonstration concentrated in Santiago in defence of the government, democratic rights and the Revolution. The images of that day are moving, shocking and terrifying at the same time. With the wisdom of hindsight, it is incredible that such a horror could happen in the face of such a conscious mass movement – but wonderful and massive movements can still be misled into disaster. The images of September 11 th are painful and terribly familiar: the bombers over the Moneda Palace, the last dignified radio appeal of Allende to the masses, the last picture of the President, helmet on his head and a weapon in his hand. Surrounded by the enemy, he would later commit suicide taking upon himself all the political and moral responsibility of his decisions. The video with the first official declarations of the newly established military Junta is nauseating. The defenders of the status quo blame the “Marxist government of Salvador Allende” for “compelling” them to take the “sad” decision of “breaking the democratic tradition” . The Parliament that Allende refused to close was closed by Pinochet – without much complaint from the parties that dominated it. As an intervention by one of the people in the debate said, the Chilean tragedy makes the politically aware viewer feel sorry but also angry. How was it possible? What would have been “the right way”, if a right way did exist? Why did the President not listen to his own supporters demanding a strong hand against Reaction? The whole of the second part of The Battle of Chile is actually fundamentally about the debate within Popular Unity, within the trade union movement, within the organisations that supported the Revolution, about what was to be done to stop the coup and keep the Revolution alive, for the establishment of a genuinely socialist Chile. A similar debate developed among the audience after the screening. Comrade Sara de Witt, ex-political prisoner under Pinochet, was also present and replied to some of the questions. Everybody in the hall realised that that discussion had a strong relevance for today's revolutionary processes in Latin America, especially the Venezuelan and Bolivian. The recent crisis in Bolivia and the events in Venezuela had not occurred yet, but a lot of what was said that night would unfortunately become even more relevant the day after, when, just on the anniversary of Pinochet’s putsch, the Bolivian Fascists staged a coup in the Eastern part of the country, while in Venezuela a plot to assassinate Chávez was disclosed and several top military officers were arrested. The US ambassadors in both countries have now been expelled as a protest against US interference to stop, once again, the revolutionary emancipation of Latin America. Several interventions from the floor were about the differences and similarities between Chile 1973 and Venezuela 2002, or Chile 1973 and Bolivia 2008. Somebody stated that in the Venezuelan Revolution the conditions are better because the Bolivarian Revolution is “peaceful but armed” , as Hugo Chávez put it. Furthermore, the class composition of the Venezuelan army is much more proletarian, also among the commanding layers, than the Chilean one, because of different traditions (the rich did not bother to send their sons into the army…). The international situation is also different, because at that time international relations were dominated by the conflict between imperialism and the USSR. Somebody else replied that President Chávez has good intentions but still needs to relieve the oligarchy of all its economic power, as is also (and even more) the case in Bolivia. Another comrade remarked that Allende was a bit of an idealist: he nationalised the mines etc., but was not prepared to organise the military measures needed to defend the conquests of the Revolution. The Chilean case set a dangerous example for the masses of the rest of Latin America and that is why imperialism decided to drown that marvellous movement in the blood of the workers, students and peasants of Chile. Another person asked about how you can measure political support. Perhaps Allende was compelled to “slow down” the process because his consensus was limited. Sara de Witt replied that the Popular Unity was constantly increasing its support, also in the elections, ever since Allende took power in 1970. Furthermore, it is not just a question of consensus in a purely electoral sense, it is also a question of enthusiasm and the arousing of the masses, which can be obtained only when a Revolution is giving results. The experience of the organisation of people’s power – workers’ committees, anti-hoarding committees, neighbourhood organisations – was a key issue in the Chilean Revolution (and it is the subject of the third part of the documentary); the film itself showed how the transport lock-out was met by the masses with an initiative from below meant to re-organise the distribution for the needs of the population – the film also shows how the workers started to act as a police force on that occasion, an example of how the bourgeois state apparatus can be replaced by another one. In answer to another question at the end of the meeting, Sara also explained that ordinary people were aware of US involvement in the conspiracy, but did not imagine to what extent. Nobody knew that the truckers’ strike received a $5m payment from the CIA – and in any case the right-wing press suppressed all information. The hypocrisy of US imperialism (the main supporter of the military coup and of the subsequent regime of terror) was also underlined, in reference to the coincidence of the 35th anniversary of September 11th, 1973, the 7th anniversary of September 11th, 2001, and the 10th anniversary of the arrest of the five Cuban heroes (Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González, and René González) in Miami, which occurred on September 12th, 1998. The meeting voted in favour of sending a message of internationalist solidarity to the Cuban Five, that you can read at Message in solidarity with the Cuban five . In the final remarks, a HOV member said that history seems easier to understand with the wisdom of hindsight, but now we are in the middle of history and we need the same wisdom on the basis of the past experience of the workers’ movement. If the failed coup in Venezuela in 2002 had had another outcome, in Bolívar Hall there would be no film screenings and discussions about revolutions and socialism, but maybe a business meeting between Venezuelan bosses and businessmen of the City. We can have different opinions on which is the right path to follow in Venezuela and Bolivia, but we cannot be neutral or renounce thinking and discussing about it. Hands Off Venezuela sides unconditionally with the Bolivarian Revolution, so that it can become that “dangerous example” for the workers, peasants and youth of the whole world that Chile was prevented from becoming.

													HOV Belgium"," Thirty people attended an emergency meeting called by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Brussels to defend the revolutions in Bolivia and Venezuela. Not only did many individuals respond to our call but also representatives of different organizations like Iniciativa Cuba Socialista, Dialogue des Peuples, CIDAL, Centro Cultural Chile, the Mapuche Committee, MAS from Bolivia and activists from the Communist Party. Present were people from Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Spain and of course… from Belgium. We got apologies from a Green MP, different unions, Vive TV Belgium, left groups, and the Venezuelan Embassy. Many people, even amongst the left, realized they were not well informed about what is happening in those countries. Erik Demeester from the HAV campaign and Marcelo Estrada from MAS Bolivia gave a short lead-off explaining what was at stake. Both of them gave their vision on how to defend the revolution. Although the comrade from MAS put emphasis on the support from foreign governments etc, many felt that only mass action could defeat the plans of the reaction. After a good discussion –informative as well as political - we decided to establish a committee for solidarity with Bolivia. The first task will be to inform our organizations and movements about what is really happening. Then we will organize a picket in front of the US Embassy in Brussels on Friday 26th of September and a political meeting later that month. It was also decided that a joint political declaration of supports should be sent to Bolivia. Contacts will also be established with left members of the European Parliament to ask them to support the revolution. ",NA,NA

													La Societé Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela Montreal"," On September the 13th at 4pm, la Societé Bolivarienne du Québec (SBQ) held a general assembly to finalize the plans for a fusion with Hands Off Venezuela Montreal (HOV). This merger is the result of over a year and a half of common work, which culminated in the most popular Latin American solidarity event in Quebec for over 5 years with close to 200 people present to hear speakers Jorge Martin and the late Celia Hart. See the report here: Celia Hart and Jorge Martin speak to a packed meeting in Montreal Over 20 activists were present at this historic meeting to unite two of the best Latin American solidarity groups in Montreal. The assembly opened with words from SBQ president Ricardo Astudillo about the importance of this meeting as a major step forward for the solidarity movement in Quebec and the excitement that he has for working united with the comrades from HOV. This was followed by the official proposition for the fusion between the two groups and the adoption of the statement of unity published below. All of the propositions were adopted unanimously with much enthusiasm. Most notably as well is the involvement of the militants from Action Creative who have pledged their talents as revolutionary film makers as well as their abilities at graphic design to the cause of the group. Many future activities of the group were also discussed, including cultural nights of resistance, solidarity with the indigenous movement in Canada, actions against the recent coup plots in Venezuela and Bolivia and a book launch for Alan Wood's new book “Reformism or Revolution”in Spanish and English. This was followed by a “Day of Cultural Resistance,” on the 14th of September, in celebration of the unity between the groups. This celebration was opened up by SBQ militant Vladimir Ilich Lopez Flores who spoke of the need to defend the Bolivarian revolution, especially in the light of the recent fascist attacks in Bolivia. This was followed by the Montreal coordinator of HOV, Lorenzo Fiorito who spoke of the importance of the fusion in furthering our abilities to make sure the Bolivarian Revolution does not remain isolated and that we spread the revolutionary experiences of the Latin American people to Canada and help build a socialist society which is international. This party lasted all day, with music performances from many Montreal Latin American musicians, including Bolivar Papineau and La Banda de Gaza.

La Societé Bolivarienne du Québec/Hands Off Venezuela is an organization in Quebec, joining the forces of revolutionaries in support of the Bolivarian Revolution. We are workers, students, Québecois, Canadians, immigrants and First Nations people, speaking a multitude of languages, but unified in our struggle to transform this society into one fit for human existence in dignity and solidarity. The Bolivarian Revolution is the shining example showing the way forward for humanity. The success of the Revolution depends greatly on events in Venezuela, Bolivia, Cuba, and other countries of Latin America. But the best defense of the Revolution is to spread it internationally, to prepare the conditions for revolution in our own countries. The Bolivarian Revolution has uplifted workers, peasants, indigenous people and the oppressed wherever it has gone. Our work in Quebec is to transmit the example and the lessons of the Revolution to the workers, the First Nations, and the oppressed of this society, to link these struggles in an internationalist, revolutionary project to overthrow capitalism and build socialism on our own land. Solidarity transforms our isolation and weakness into strength through diversity. Ensemble nous vaincrons - Hasta la victoria siempre! ",NA,NA

													Mauro Vanetti - HOV London"," We have met yesterday, September 10 th , 2008, in the Bolívar Hall in London, for the screening of The Battle of Chile - The Coup d'État , a documentary on the US-backed terrorism in Chile in 1973 that led to the establishment of Pinochet's dictatorship. Today, September 11 th , 2008, is the 35 th anniversary of the coup against the Socialist government led by Salvador Allende. More than 3,000 people died in the USA as a consequence of the terrorist attacks of September 11 th , 2001. More than 3,000 people died in Chile as a consequence of the coup of September 11 th , 1973, assassinated by the US-backed dictatorship. More than 3,000 people died in Cuba in the last 50 years as a consequence of US-backed terrorism, aimed at the restoration of capitalism and imperialist rule in the island. Ten years ago tomorrow, on September 12 th , 1998, five Cubans were arrested in Miami and indicted by the US government with false accusations. These five courageous men were in Florida to prevent further terrorist attacks against Cuba and its people by infiltrating Hermanos al Rescate , a terrorist Cuban-American organisation that uses civilian aircrafts to violate Cuban airspace. The five Cuban heroes (Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González, and René González) have since been held in US prisons after a frame-up trial. This is a blatant human-rights violation, condemned by several different organisations and individuals, including the UN Commissions on Human Rights and the 3-judge panel of US Court of Appeals for the 11 th Circuit that ordered a new trial 3 years ago. This decision was later to be reversed by the full panel, in a situation reminiscent of several other politically motivated judicial scandals in US history. The meeting discussed the hypocrisy of the US government when it tries to present itself as an opponent of terror and defender of democracy. The just opposition of the US people against terrorist attacks is exploited by the White House, when it serves its purposes, in order to declare imperialist wars and constrain the democratic rights of its own citizens. When it better suits its interests and the interests of US multinationals, the US government promotes terror, military coups and the assassination of political enemies. In the case of the Cuban Five, this pro-terror attitude reaches the point of jailing five heroes who were only trying to defend their people from a terrorist organisation! The meeting voted in favour of sending a message of internationalist solidarity to Gerardo, Antionio, Ramón, Fernando and René, in the 10 th anniversary of their arrest. Free the Cuban Five!

													Hands Off Venezuela"," The ongoing coup attempt in Bolivia continues, and yesterday 8 peasants were killed when they were ambushed by fascist gangs of the oligarchy. In the working class area of Plan 3000 in Santa Cruz, the people repelled the fascist gangs which had attempted to enter this area to spread fear. As a result of these provocations Evo Morales has expelled the US ambassador. In the evening of Thursday a coup plot was uncovered in Venezuela . The people immediately gathered outside Miraflores and Chavez addressed them announcing the expulsion of the US ambassador . A mass meeting of PSUV activists and leaders took place afterwards at the Fuerte San Carlos and it was agreed to call a march for today outside Fuerte Tiuna, the city's main military barracks and mass demonstrations in all the regional capitals on Saturday. It is time to say enough is enough. The oligarchy in Venezuela and Bolivia has shown once and again their lack of respect for the democratic will of the majority of the people. We need to organise solidarity. Urgent meetings should take place to plan actions of solidarity around the world. There should be rallies outside of the US embassies and public assemblies to discuss the situation and coordinate further action. The Venezuelan and Bolivian embassies around the world must contacted to help and participate in this mobilisation.

			HOV Indonesia embraces youth, workers, women, urban poor, and young artists",2008-08-22T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ted Sprague – HOV Indonesia"," Since its launch on 28 April 2008 , HOV (Hands off Venezuela) Indonesia has become an active medium for discussions on the Venezuelan Revolution, especially around the issue of nationalization of the oil and gas industry in Indonesia, a central demand which has been rallied by nearly all youth and trade union militants, and has been welcomed with great enthusiasm. It has managed to reach out to various marginalized sectors of the population: the youth, workers, women, urban poor, and young artists. On May 5 th , HOV Indonesia was invited by a group of revolutionary students from UNAS (National University of Jakarta) to talk about political development in Venezuela and the gains made there. The discussion was so informative and inspiring that one student decided to do his thesis on the Bolivarian Revolution. On May 24 th , a couple of weeks later, UNAS became a battleground when hundreds of police brutally attacked students inside the university who were protesting against fuel price increases. Tear gas was shot inside the campus and students were shot with rubber bullets. At the end 148 students were arrested and one student, Maftuh Fauzi, died from a head injury inflicted by the police. As has always been the case, the police and the state deny any responsibility and went as far as concocting a lie that Maftuh died of AIDS! Women have been the most exploited layer of society in Indonesia. With the recent 30% increase in the price of fuel, women are bearing the brunt of this attack more than anyone else. On May 13 th , HOV Indonesia along with JNPM (Jaringan Nasional Perempuan Mahardhika or the Mahardhika Women National Network) organized a screening of No Volveran in response to this fuel price increase. Attended by dozens of urban poor housewives, this screening of No Volveran was followed by a discussion about the nationalization of the oil industry and how multinational oil companies cause this so-called ""energy crisis"". HOV Indonesia was also able to attract the interests of street musicians and artists in the city of Bogor. On June 5, HOV Indonesia was invited by a group of young street artists, known as ""Libertan"", to talk about the gains made in Venezuela in their monthly political discussion group. ""For us who are marginalized,"" said one of the members of Libertan, ""doing the arts is political. And we are hearing that there is a mass movement that is capable of bringing revolution in Venezuela"". At the end of the discussion, Libertan and HOV Indonesia agreed to hold more discussion groups in order to widen the understanding of socialism amongst street artists in Bogor. No Volveran, which was premiered during the launching of HOV Indonesia, has become a very popular documentary. It has been screened by many organizations: youth, women, urban poor, students, and trade unions. The lessons of workers' control in the factory of Sanitarios Maracay is of particular interest amongst the workers. To date, more than 200 copies have been distributed across Indonesia by Rumah Kiri, a member of the HOV Indonesia campaign. This number is more likely to be higher since there are other organizations who are distributing this documentary which HOV Indonesia is not aware of. The HOV Indonesia website too has become a leading source of information on the unfolding revolutionary process in Venezuela. Many articles have been translated into Bahasa Indonesia, which is providing militants at home with lessons from Venezuela. The launch of Hands Off Venezuela in Indonesia was also mentioned by Telesur, a Pan-Latin American television program ( Campaña ""Manos Fuera de Venezuela"" llega hasta Indonesia ). In such a short time and with a minimal resources consisting of no more than a group of dedicated revolutionaries, the campaign has accomplished many things. As the revolution in Venezuela unfolds, and as the oppressed in Indonesia rise up to their historic task, this campaign will play an even more important role in linking up these struggles. ",NA,NA

			President Chavez Meets with a Delegation of Hands Off Venezuela in Madrid",2008-07-26T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Representatives the international Hands Off Venezuela campaign jointly organized a morning meeting in the ""Parque del Este"" park in Madrid in front of the statue of Simon Bolivar. Some 100 people participated, including trade union leaders from the CCOO and STES labor federations. Also present were members of the Spanish Students' Union , the Marxist current El Militante , the Coordination of Immigrant Workers, of ""Alianza País"", the Movement of Rafael Correa in Ecuador, the Bolivarian Platform, and the Coordination of Solidarity with Cuba, who extended their greetings to those gathered. The event was energetic, with slogans that reflected the enormous combativity of those in attendance, who were inspired by the revolutionary example of Venezuela, chanting slogans such as: ""Hands Off Venezuela!"" ""Alert! Alert! Alert! Socialist Revolution is Spreading Across Latin America!"" ""Native or Foreign Born - the Same Working Class!"" and ""Uh, Ah, Chavez Will Not Go!"" Three large banners were also present: ""Hands Off Venezuela"" ""For a Socialist Federation of Latin America"" and ""May They Never Shut You Up, Comandante"" - a reference to last year's confrontation with the Spanish King, who told Chavez to ""shut up"". A large number of media were present, particularly Venezuelan media, and we were able to discuss with them, particularly the main state channel Venezolana de Television and Telesur. The event ended with a few words from Juanjo López, general secretary of the Spanish Students' Union, and Miriam Municio, spokesperson for Hands Off Venezuela in Spain. They explained the objectives of the gathering and the enormous importance of international solidarity. Juanjo López explained how the revolution is striking terror in the hearts of the imperialists. They are deathly afraid that it will spread worldwide - which is already beginning. This is why they spread lies about what is really happening in Venezuela: the beginnings of a profound change in society and the struggle for socialism. Miriam Municio explained that the economic crisis shaking the big capitalist powers is an example of the impossibility to have ""capitalism with a human face"". This is proven by the recently approved legislation which extends the workweek of European workers to 65 hours. This is why the only solution is socialism. This is why we defend the Venezuelan revolution, why we think it should continue forward, expropriating the key levers of the economy, which remain in the hands of the capitalists, and why the revolution needs to abolish the bourgeois state, which aims to boycott the revolution. This event was an example of the kind of solidarity the revolution needs: internationalist working class solidarity. The victory of the Venezuelan Revolution would be a decisive lever to transform the world. At the same time, representatives of Hands Off Venezuela and the Students' Union in Mallorca organized a reception for President Chavez with a banner that read: ""Welcome Comrade Chavez, Solidarity with the Latin American Revolution"". Later in the day, members of Hands off Venezuela and others were able to participate in a press conference held by President Chavez and Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero at the Moncloa Presidential Palace. The comrades hoped to ask about the nationalizations the Chavez government is carrying out to the benefit of the Venezuelan working class and people in general. Nationalizations like that of Sidor are criticized by the capitalists, and yet they have no qualms about bailing out banks affected by the crisis of the financial sector with billions in taxpayer money. We wanted to know Chavez' opinion of this hypocritical attitude of the bourgeoisie, but unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to ask the question. President Chavez made it clear that Venezuela is in the middle of a revolution. He explained that this is taking place throughout Latin America and that whoever does not see this does not want to see it. He said that we are immersed in an enormous crisis at all levels: food, energy, finances and even moral. He asserted that this was nothing more nor less than the crisis of the entire epoch. We share this analysis with the President. At the Torrejón military base, from where the President was leaving for Venezuela, Chavez met with a delegation of representatives from the Spanish Students' Union, Hands Off Venezuela, and the Marxist tendency El Militante. The reception was very warm. We invited President Chavez to return to Madrid in the Spring to participate a mass event of solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution, like the event organized by Hands Off Venezuela in Vienna in May of 2006 . Chavez was very interested in the Students Union, and informed us that he had seen the Hands Off Venezuela delegation in Venezuela. He also asked if Alan Woods, founder of Hands Off Venezuela was around. He said he had followed Alan's tour in Venezuela when he presented his new book Reformism Or Revolution: Marxism and Socialism of the 21st Century (reply to Heinz Dieterich) . The delegation also gave the President some political materials, including the latest book published by the Frederck Engels Foundation, History of the Russian Revolution by Leon Trotsky. Chavez was very pleased and expressed great interest. The discussion ended with the cry: ""Fatherland or death: we will be victorious!"" Just before the President got back on the plane to return to Venezuela, we took pictures with Chavez, with our fists in the air, yelling ""Long live revolution! Long live socialism!"" The President encouraged us to continue the struggle and insisted on the need to transform the system. ",NA,NA

			“The Battle of Chile” (1st part) screened in London",2008-09-02T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Mauro Vanetti - HOV London"," On August 20 th , 2008, the film season Venezuela: a revolution on film , organised in London by Hands Off Venezuela in association with the Venezuelan Embassy, attracted more than forty people again to the screening of the first part of The Battle of Chile . As usual, Pablo Roldan (HOV) introduced the screening in Bolívar Hall. This documentary is a fantastic video document on the Chilean Revolution and its defeat, shot during the course of the events by Patricio Gúzman and his team. The first part covers the period of time spanning from March 1973, when the left-wing coalition Popular Unity gets 43.7% of the votes, preventing the Right from legally impeaching the Socialist President Salvador Allende, until the first coup attempt, less than four months later. The title of this part is, significantly, The Insurrection of the Bourgeoisie . In fact, the failure of the right-wing parties (the US-supported Christian Democrats, National Party and others) to obtain a two-third majority comes as a completely unexpected result to the middle-class supporters of counter-revolution. While documenting the last skirmishes of the electoral campaign, the film-makers visit the luxurious house of a right-wing family, immerge into a proletarian crowd at a Popular Unity event asking what has changed in their lives since Allende came to power, and interview drivers of expensive cars while the cameraman explores details of their vehicles or outfits. Using such effective devices, the film illuminates for the supporters of either side, their class position and their political opinions. You cannot help appreciating how the latter strongly correlates with the former. Even more than the plebeian determination to support the Socialist government in the hope of a decisive change in society, something else instantly brings to mind contemporary accounts of the situation in Venezuela or Bolivia, viz the arrogance and class hatred of the most dreadfully outspoken supporters of the Right. While most rich right-wingers declare that they are in favour of the legal path to get rid of “the Communist, Marxist bastards” , several, especially when the early electoral results seem to confirm the predicted right-wing triumph, assert more ruthless intentions: “And now he ’ll have to leave the country!” It is exactly this language which is used by those who oppose Chávez, Morales or Correa today – at least, when they do not expressly demand the execution of those left-wing presidents. This is just the beginning of a whole series of striking resemblances between Chile 1973 and the reactionary conspiracies trying to stop the current revolutionary processes in Latin America. As in Bolivia, Ecuador or Venezuela, the Chilean opposition explored all possibilities in order to overthrow the elected government that was menacing the domination of imperialism and the profits of the national bourgeoisie. First of all, they tried to use their narrow majority in the parliament to paralyse the government’s action. Reforms promulgated by the government were unfunded or cancelled by the right-wing MPs (Christian Democrats and Nationalists alike). Ministers appointed by Allende were recalled. “Enquiries” were set up to investigate the actions of the bodies created by the revolutionary process, like the neighbourhood committees against hoarding and speculation ( Juntas de Abastecimiento y Precios ). Allende’s obsession with a pedant respect of parliamentary and constitutional procedures resulted in a standstill: as Marx and Engels wrote about the Paris Commune, “the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes” . The plan of the ruling class was to create a situation that could justify a military intervention, as the film explained. This plan implied different kinds of manoeuvres. The transport strike combined with the US embargo to disrupt food supplies and the whole economy of the country. Shopkeepers and other middle-class sectors joined the struggle against Allende with lock-outs. The film shows a conference of an association of taxi and truck owners during the organisation of the strike, followed by scenes from the daily life of thousands of working-class families who organised to resist the sabotage. Right-wing and moderate students’ associations also had their share of participation in the conspiracy. A progressive reform of education was blocked by the protests of those students’ groups, often involving violent street fights with Young Socialists and Young Communists. The students of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile were mainly the sons and daughters of the oligarchs and supporters of gremialismo , a conservative Catholic university movement close to Fascism. The film-makers sarcastically underline how suddenly they all became very interested in supporting strikes, inviting right-wing trade unionists to their meetings, collecting money for them etc. Hands Off Venezuela has already explained that the nature of the Venezuelan “democratic students’ movement” is not much different – and they also started to mobilise in opposition to a progressive reform of the university system, using private universities for the rich as their strongholds. The strike by a relatively privileged section of copper miners, the workers of the huge mine of El Teniente, nationalised by Allende, is also described in the film. In a very impressive, albeit sad, scene of the documentary, a pro-Allende trade unionist is given the opportunity to speak to a massive meeting of right-wing miners in a stadium. Just before him, the leader of the right-wing miners has said that “Our interests come first, then Chile’s” . When he starts to explain why he does not support a strike with the demand for a special increase in the wages of El Teniente miners only, called with the clear purpose of paralysing the country’s economy and destabilising the government, the crowd starts to whistle and boo, and the whole stadium chants the appalling slogan “No politics! No politics!” As if they could ignore politics in Chile 1973! (Their leaders ignored politics so much that they managed to have a brilliant career in the official dictatorship-backed trade unions after Pinochet came to power.) Nevertheless, not all workers at El Teniente approved the strike. This reminds us of the role played by the workers of PDVSA (Venezuela’s state-owned oil company), in preventing the bosses’ lock-out from destabilising the country in December 2002. The film-makers interviewed several left-wing workers that refused to go on strike and managed to sustain the vital copper production until the majority of miners came back to work. The friendly approach of Allende towards these misled workers is also clearly shown in the documentary. At the same time, an increasing number of Allende supporters start to question his ultra-gradualist approach and his soft hand with the Reaction. They are not only the more extreme left-wing groups like the MIR or the MAPU, but also average Socialist and Communist workers. Fascist groups like Fatherland and Freedom ( Patria y Libertad ) raise their heads more and more, openly calling for the violent removal of Allende and the reversal of all his reforms. The United States are clearly manoeuvring behind the scenes, assisting the Right both financially and by providing CIA agents as “instructors”. During a mass demonstration in support of the government, a man is killed by “Christian Democrat” sharpshooters on the roof of the party building. His funeral turns into another large scale event. The first part of The Battle of Chile ends with the shocking images of the first coup attempt, known as Tanquetazo because the right-wing officers who assaulted the presidential palace used tanks. The coup failed, after taking some innocent lives – one of them being Leonardo Henrichsen, an Argentinean cameraman who filmed his own death. The film terminates with the terrible scene of a military aiming at the camera and shooting. At the end of the screening, there was some time for questions and debate. Roberto Navarrete was introduced to the audience: he was a political prisoner under Pinochet and he now lives in the UK. He explained how the events in Chile were connected with the international situation and how the hand of the United States was behind each counter-revolutionary manoeuvre at least since Allende arrived second in the presidential elections of 1964, a loud alarm bell for the Department of State. He also underlined the similarities between the Venezuelan revolutionary process and the Chilean one – and the significant economic difference consisting of the fact that copper prices were at a low in Allende’s times while oil, Venezuela’s main export, has reached record-high prices during Chávez years; this, combined with the strengthening of the Left on a continental scale, creates a more favourable context for Socialist policies, giving the Bolivarian Revolution a certain breathing space that Chile could not enjoy. There was a question about stockpiling and the black market. A similar problem with food speculation exists in Venezuela at the present time. Pablo Roldan explained that it is the result of both a conscious sabotage of the oligarchs and an automatic reaction of the “invisible hand” of capitalism against any form of strong state intervention in the distribution of commodities. In Venezuela very few capitalist companies control food production and distribution, which gives them a powerful tool to sabotage price control and try to starve the Revolution to death; at the same time, price control in a capitalist framework reduces profit and therefore encourages capital to be invested elsewhere. The only solution lies in the expropriation of the big monopolies and the involvement of the workers not only in neighbourhood committees but in the running of the nationalised companies. The same applied to Chile at that time. Several questions focused on why the Chilean Revolution did not manage to fight back against the violence of the reaction. Allende and the Left had millions of supporters, why were they not given arms? A comrade from the audience recalled how mass demonstrations were actually demanding weapons but Allende refused to deliver them to the workers; in his opinion, this reformist attitude was the main reason for the defeat. We will see in more detail in the next part of the movie what kind of tactics was chosen by the government to deal with the unreliable officers of the Chilean army after the first coup attempt. Roberto Navarrete said that this is a highly controversial issue within the Chilean Left and there are different evaluations. Clearly, Allende and the more moderate wing of Popular Unity (a wing of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Radical Party and others) favoured the idea of a peaceful and legal path to socialism. In his intervention, Rob Sewell (editorial board of Socialist Appeal ) explained that for him it was necessary to study and also criticise the role of Salvador Allende in the Chilean Revolution, but at the same time we have to remember that Allende honestly believed in the constitutional path to socialism, which is shown by his own heroic sacrifice, when he committed suicide while the presidential palace was surrounded by Pinochet’s troops. Our criticism against his reformist mistakes is therefore of a comradely and fraternal character. What prevented the Chilean Revolution to go all the way was not just a military issue – basically, it was a political one. Popular Unity did not go all the way in and this created the political conditions that, together with economic chaos, weariness and disillusionment, paved the way for the Reaction until its final revenge on September 11 th 1973. The army ranks themselves are made of working-class people. Victorious revolutions have always managed to split the army along class lines, thus neutralising its counter-revolutionary potential. Therefore arming the people is correct but it is not a panacea in itself and cannot be separated by other political tasks. Chile shows that the ruling class will never give up its power without a struggle, and it will use all possible ways to remove a government that is arousing the workers and consciously or unconsciously inciting them to take power, and therefore it is necessary to spoil them of their economic power by expropriating the commanding heights of economy. The bourgeois state apparatus will refuse to serve the opposite purpose to the one for which it was created and perfected decades or centuries ago, and therefore it needs to be smashed and replaced with a different system, based on workers’ democracy and self-organisation. This is not just a Chilean thing, because the same can apply to any other capitalist country, including Britain. (The novel A Very British Coup and its TV adaptation were also mentioned by Rob).

													Mauro Vanetti - HOV London"," On July 10th, 2008, more than fifty people attended a London screening of the 2004 documentary, Venezuela Bolivariana . The event was held in Bolívar Hall and was the third part of the film season, Venezuela: a revolution on film , organised by Hands Off Venezuela in association with the Venezuelan Embassy. This film has become a classic for Venezuela solidarity activities due to its great educational value and its focus on the voice of rank-and-file activists and grassroots supporters of the Revolution. It covers the period from the Caracazo uprising in 1989 to the first months after the failed coup of April 2002. Film makers Marcelo Andrade and the Calle y Media Collective explain the early development of the Venezuelan Revolution out of the appalling social and political conditions of the pre-Chávez Fourth Republic, as well as the first social measures and the victorious popular resistance against the attempted right-wing coup and imperialist interference. The scenes of the masses' fight to overturn the coup, in the face of violent capitalist repression, and Chávez's first speech after the putsch's defeat are really moving and inspirational. {youtube}CZiqDVxPZuw{/youtube} Venezuela Bolivariana completely debunks several myths about Hugo Chávez and the Bolivarian Revolution without resorting to propaganda. It shows the reason why the 1992 military uprising led by Chávez enjoyed a mass support as eventually displayed by the victory of the MVR in the 1998 elections. It demolishes with factual video documents the right-wing TV propaganda about the alleged massacre of Puente Llaguno that was used as a justification for the 2002 TV-supported coup. It exposes the real nature of the ""democratic opposition"", not using the words of the government supporters but through their own words: in a series of revealing interviews during anti-Chávez rallies and in right-wing neighbourhoods, the opinions of the rich, white and bigoted oppositionists come to the surface as the most overt expression of class prejudice and antidemocratic arrogance. For example, one of them says that the rich must get richer so that the poorer will benefit from their ""investments"", therefore their wealth must be protected from the likes of President Chávez; another one openly declares that the Bolivarian government must be removed at any cost and afterwards only ""the educated, the upper classes"" must govern again... After the screening, Jorge Martin (Hands Off Venezuela) explained that several events happened after the ones shown in the film. As many attendees noticed, in the film nobody talking openly about socialism. At that time, ""Bolivarism"" was considered the only acceptable definition of the process, but in January 2005 President Chávez opened a mass debate on the future of the Revolution declaring that the country was heading towards a socialist transformation. In the film, the ex-guerrilla turned oppositionist Teodoro Petkoff explained that Chávez never nationalised anything but only delivered abstract speeches that scared the middle class. This was true at that time but it is not true any more, since some nationalisations, factory occupations and land seizures have occurred in the following years. Jorge Martin explained the limited character of these measures and the need to go beyond the capitalist system. The third point raised by comrade Martin was that you cannot have half a revolution and the slowness of the pace of social change is creating some tiredness among the masses, as shown by the defeat of the constitutional referendum in December 2007. At the same time, economic power is still largely in the hands of the capitalist elite, which implies a very serious threat of sabotage to the Revolution. Since the 2002 coup the Venezuelan people have defeated both the overt and the covert manouvers of the oligarchy and the imperialists, but now the situation is at a crucial point. The question is whether the masses will find the necessary leadership that could bring about the ""Revolution within the Revolution"" against the internal bureaucracy in red shirts, evoked in the last part of the film. Andy Higginbottom of Colombia Solidarity Campaign was the next speaker. He dealt with the recent developments of the situation in Colombia after the show-liberation of Íngrid Betancourt, kidnapped by the FARC in 2002. Andy explained how the mass media select the news in such a way that the most relevant information is not revealed to the general public, and this is especially the case about Colombia. Hundreds of thousands of displaced peasants, assassinated trade unionists and victimised left-wing activists are not part of the story forged by the propaganda machine about Colombia. While the Colombia Solidarity Campaign does not agree with the kidnappings, it is a scandal that we should only be supposed to pity Mrs Betancourt while ignoring the crimes of the Uribe regime. Amancay Colque also spoke from the platform. She is a leading member of the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign and a Bolivian herself. She described how the mood among the masses dramatically changed in the last decade in Bolivia, as a part of a continental process where the workers, the peasants and the urban poor of the whole of Latin America have raised their heads against US-backed Neo-Liberal policies. Now, the government of Evo Morales is in danger because of a vicious right-wing manoeuvre that uses the banner of ""local autonomy"" to promote the overthrowing of the elected government of the MAS. Next August 10th there will be a recall referendum to revoke the positions of Evo Morales and of the regional prefects, and this will become a rallying point both for the revolution and the counter-revolution! Many contributions came from the floor about all subjects touched both by the film and the speakers, allowing a very good debate to develop. A meeting about Latin America always raises several key issues that are relevant for every worker and militant in Europe, like immigration, the role of the working class today, mixed economy vs. socialism, and much more besides. We need more meetings like this! ",NA,NA

			The founding conference of Hands off Venezuela Finland",2008-06-17T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV-Sweden"," The advances of the Bolivarian revolution are increasingly capturing the attention of activists all over the world and Finland is definitely no exception to that rule. Last weekend, fittingly on Che Guevara's 80th birthday, we witnessed the founding conference of Hands off Venezuela Finland. Around 30 people attended in a very small office in central Helsinki courtesy of Performers and Artists for Nuclear Disarmament (PAND) at what was a combined founding conference and a birthday party for Che Guevara. Worth noting is that the event was attended by the Cuban ambassador to Finland who spoke about the importance of Che Guevara's internationalist outlook and that the defence of the Cuban revolution and the progress of the Bolivarian revolution go hand in hand. Hands off Venezuela Finland actually started two years ago as a discussion group on Yahoo. After slowly attracting more attention the discussion group felt it was time to transform itself into an open campaigning organisation. The meeting raised the necessary 60 euros that is the fee for formally registering an organisation in Finland. The last two years have not simply been about discussions on the internet. During 2007 some activities were already reported on this website, such as a seminar at the Helsinki Social Forum and later Helsinki was the last stop for Gema Belandria's Scandinavian speaking tour . However, the step to formally establish an open campaign organisation comes from a desire for more activities that meet the public eye. Invited speakers were also Patrik Olofsson from HoV-Sweden who gave a quick overview of the work of the HoV campaign internationally and the history and lessons of the campaign work in Sweden. The political youth organisations on the left have greatly welcomed our campaign. We have had some difficulties in establishing the campaign in the trade unions, but with speakers' tours like the one with Antonio Betancourt from Inveval, we will get the key for opening many doors to the trade unions at local level. After the formalities of the conference had ended, the meeting swiftly converted into a lively social event. Many revolutionary songs, both Finnish and Latin American, where sung during the night. The celebration of HoV-Finland and Che Guevara's birthday went on into the early morning. Dear comrades and friends, I would like to send revolutionary Bolivarian greetings to the founding conference of Hands Off Venezuela Finland. Recently we have seen an escalation of US aggression against the Venezuelan revolution, the re-forming of the IV Fleet, violation of Venezuelan air-space, the increased propaganda campaign around the so-called ""Reyes laptop"" which allegedly ""proves"" Venezuela's links with the FARC, the attempt to include Venezuela in the list of countries who ""harbour and sponsor"" terrorists... These are all clear signs that the Venezuelan revolution is still in danger and we must redouble our efforts to defend it. Defending and supporting the Venezuelan revolution is not something we do just out of solidarity. The struggle of Venezuelan workers and peasants is also relevant to us. The struggle for free education, free health care for all, against imperialism, for workers' rights and workers' control, against privatisation, these are all issues that affect us directly. The Bolivarian revolution is also a source of inspiration because it has once again put the issue of socialism on the agenda. For all these reasons, the best way to defend the Venezuelan revolution and the growing revolutionary wave which is sweeping across Latin America is to prepare the conditions for revolutionary change in our own countries. We wish you every success in your conference. Viva la revolucion bolivariana! Viva la revolucion socialista! Venceremos!

			Report of film screening “Memory of a plunder” in London",2008-06-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Manuel Reichetseder - HOV London"," About seventy people gathered yesterday, June 19, in London's Bolivar Hall for the second part of the film season Venezuela : a revolution on film , which is organised by Hands off Venezuela in association with the Venezuelan embassy in the UK. This time we viewed ""Memory of a plunder"" by the Argentinean film director Fernando ""Pino"" Solanas, which marked his return to social documentary filming. In this breathtaking documentary Solanas deals with what happened to his country in the 1980s and 1990s. It describes the economic and social decline of Argentina, in the past the richest country on the Latin American continent. The governments of Alfonsín, Menem and De la Rúa privatised nearly every state owned company, including YPF, the oil and gas company, which was a motor of the nation's wealth. ""Everything that belongs to the state should be in private hands"" was the motto of President Carlos Menem, who came to power in 1989. An alliance of foreign banks and multinationals, including Spanish, Italian, French, US and British companies, in collaboration with local capitalist groups, judges, politicians from all parties, generals and elements from the old dictatorship, divided the wealth of the country among themselves, with devastating effects for ordinary people. Millions of people became unemployed and sank into poverty, and malnutrition became widespread. Eventually in December 2001, after 3 years of recession, the Argentine financial system collapsed. The life savings of millions of people, who had worked their whole life to guarantee themselves a decent living when they retired, were frozen in the banks while at the same time multinationals took billions of dollars out of the country. Six months earlier the IMF had been presenting the ""Argentinean miracle"" as the example to follow for Latin America. The people of Buenos Aires streamed out onto the streets in hundreds of thousands, protesting against the self-enrichment of the companies and demanding their money back. The mood and anger expressed itself in violent street protests, clashes with the police and several deaths. The events of December resulted in the overthrow of President De la Rúa. But the protests continued and in the following two weeks the country saw three more presidents. The meeting then continued with a discussion led by Mario Rodriguez from the organisation Wayna Tambo from El Alto, Bolivia, and Jorge Martín, International Secretary of Hands Off Venezula. Mario Rodriguez said that with a few changes here and there the events in Argentina are similar to the history of every other Latin American country. Jorge Martín then stressed the point that the process of privatisation is also taking place here in Britain, and that it's time to name things by their real name, that so called neo-liberalism is in truth capitalism, and globalisation, which is a nice word, is imperialism. It's the capitalist system which causes misery for billions of people all over the world and that in his opinion it's time to move forward to socialism. This was then followed by questions and comments from the audience. The next screening will take place on Wednesday July 9 with the film ""Venezuela Bolivariana"". This film examines the Bolivarian Revolution of Venezuela and its connection to the world-wide movement against capitalist globalisation. {youtube}BNCeK4E6sqY{/youtube} ",NA,NA

			'No Volveran' screened in Amsterdam",2008-06-20T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV-Belgium"," This was quite a challenge! The Bolivarian Circle of Holland and the Hands Off Venezuela campaign planned the screening of ‘No Volveran' for the same evening as the Dutch football team entered the stadium to beat France in the European Championship. Despite this very uneven competition, 26 people filled the venue at the University of Amsterdam, many Latino people, Chileans and Venezuelans, Dutch people, left-wing Turks and a few Belgians. An experienced team of the Bolivarian Circle dealt smoothly with all the technical aspects of the evening. Rodrigo Rojas and Erik Demeester welcomed everybody and introduced the film. Both of them also stressed the importance of the collaboration between both groups. The screening was followed by a lively debate in Dutch and Spanish. The first questions dealt with the occupied factories and under workers' control. What happened to the struggle of the workers of Sanitarios Maracay asked someone? At the beginning of 2007 the situation did not look very rosy. The battle for the nationalisation of the factory was lost as the Minister of Labour rejected the idea itself. Very different was the fate of the struggle of the workers of the Sidor steel plant who fought and succeeded in having it nationalised thanks to the direct intervention of Chavez. A Venezuelan activist, however, brought some good news. He told us that a commission of workers of Sanitarios have met with the new Minister of Labour. He seemed to have agreed to nationalise the factory and to get the necessary finances to restart production. If this information is confirmed it would be a new turn in the situation. Other questions also dealt with the economic situation in the country and the way the revolution was dealing with the economic sabotage organised by the oligarchy. The state of food production was commented on. An example was given of how peasants resorted to barter to try to get around the control of the oligarchy over food production. On the other hand, the recent nationalisation of a big milk processing plant shows the importance of getting full public control of the complete food processing industry under the democratic control of the workers and the communities. Later in the evening a Venezuelan comrade told us how much she liked the documentary. ""Many films dealt essentially with the social conquests - ‘los logros' - of the revolution. What struck me in this documentary was how the movement from below was presented in images. The question of the consciousness and the level of organisation was featured, something which rarely happens in other films."" A nice compliment! Concluding the activity Rodrigo again stressed the importance of collaboration between the Bolivarian Circle and Hands Off Venezuela. This collaboration was made possible thanks to a young Dutch socialist activist, Zowi. This is a first step and surely not the last one. At the stall of HOV we sold almost 100 euros worth of DVDs, pamphlets and copies of Vonk . More information on the Bolivarian circle of Holland here . ",NA,NA

			Report back from Peruvian Alternative Summit in London",2008-06-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," For its special monthly meeting on Wednesday June 11th, HOV London invited Andy Higginbottom from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign to give a report back on the alternative summit held in Peru recently, at the same time as the official EU - Latin American summit. One of the main organisers of the alternative summit was a group called Enlazando Alternativas (Launching Alternatives), a network of progressive groups from Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America concerned with the effects of neo-liberal policies. The summit featured tribunals on European corporations in Latin America, with 32 cases on their impact on the working classes and indigenous populations. Peru is a tough place for the left, Andy explained, as there is always an association in people’s mind with Maoist group Shining Path. However, social movements are on the rise, as shown by recent strikes by miners, peasants and doctors. Alan Garcia, the recently re-elected neo-liberal president of Peru, tried to have the alternative summit banned, but backed down under European pressure. The main clash at the official summit was between Garcia and Bolivian President Evo Morales, said Andy, with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez staying out of the limelight, and with Garcia firmly on the side of the multinationals and the EU. EU representative Peter Mandelson tried to bully President Morales into accepting free trade agreements. Whereas Morales proposed a progressive removal of trade barriers, Mandelson wanted to impose a free trade deal, which should come as no surprise. Evo Morales spoke at the alternative summit. In what was seen as an attack on prominent left wing politician Ollanta Humala, Morales spokes of the need for a left leader who was accountable to the social movements, rather than one seeking to capitalise on them. Regarding the EU, he stressed that the privatisation of water and other resources was not up for negotiation, and the same applied to intellectual rights. His position was not fully anti-capitalist, but more democratic protectionist, said Andy. A lively question and answer session followed, with calls for greater cooperation between the various Latin American solidarity groups, and perhaps to emulate what Enlazando Alternativas has created - a kind of network or umbrella organisation for progressive groups concerned with Latin America.

													Melanie MacDonald"," The Communications Workers Union (CWU) invited Hands Off Venezuela along with other Latin American solidarity campaigns and guest speakers to speak at a Latin America fringe meeting held on the opening day of the Union's Annual Conference in Liverpool last Sunday. The CWU is Britain's largest trade union for the communications industry with 250,000 members, including post office and British Telecom workers. The CWU renewed their affiliation to Hands Off Venezuela, reaffirming the importance of the Venezuelan revolution to workers here in the UK. William Roche from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign summarized many of the most important developments that have taken place in Venezuela over the past year. He explained that whilst enormous improvements to living standards have been made thanks to the social welfare programs funded by oil revenues, the key to transforming Venezuelan society in the long term lays in the factory occupation movement, the communal councils, and in the building of a revolutionary party that will implement, at a national level, everything that is being fought for at a grass roots level. The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which held it's founding congress earlier this year, could fulfil that role. A fifth of the country's population has already joined the party membership, and the party could win seats in the regional elections later this year. William also outlined the developments in the Venezuelan labour movement, in particular the victorious campaign waged by the workers of Venezuela's largest steel plant, SIDOR. Their campaign was so effective that they pressurised President Chavez into nationalising the plant, despite the diplomatic problems created by pushing out Argentinean / Italian majority shareholders. But, William continued,every advancement that has been made toward building socialism of the 21 st century has been met with fierce opposition. Inside Venezuela, a campaign of economic sabotage by local elites is attempting to create chaos. The US is stepping up it's media campaign of slander and disinformation. And Colombia, the regional ally of the US, made a cross border attack on Ecuador, killing 23, including one of the leaders of FARC engaged in hostage release talks with Venezuela. A new US military base is being planned in Colombia to be built right on the border of Venezuela. But most worryingly, is the reformation of the US Navy's Fourth Fleet, which will patrol Latin American and Caribbean seas under the pretense of fighting terror and Narco trafficking. At the same time a pretext for some kind of US military intervention into Venezuela is being prepared in the US Congress in a bid to add Venezuela to their list of countries that supposedly sponsor terrorist activities. Accusations that have been made but never proved true. With Venezuela under increased attack, William appealed for continued support for the revolution, and to the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. He finished by recalling how workers in Venezuela, when asked how British workers could best help defend the revolution, they replied; ""by building revolution in your own countries"". This final statement by the speaker led to a round of applause from the audience of trade union activists, who followed up with a round of interesting and inspiring contributions and questions.

The two speakers were Marcos Garcia, labor attache from the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, DC and Jorge Martin from the international Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. Marcos explained how he was trying to make links with the US Labor Movement, to counter the lies about Venezuela prevalent in the US media. Marcos also provided a short history of the Venezuelan labor movement and explained the situation today. Jorge explained the role of the international HOV campaign. Jorge then discussed the main events of the Venezuelan Revolution since 2002. Jorge examined the dangers facing the Venezuelan Revolution and how the Revolution needs to be completed. The meeting then opened up for discussion. There were 23 people in attendance. $84 was collected to help pay for the expenses of transporting Jorge from Europe to North America and around the USA and Canada on his speaking tour. Unfortunately, the large universities: City University, Columbia, NYU and Fordham have all closed for the summer, otherwise more students would have certainly been present.

The topic of the meeting was about Latin America and the revolutionary struggle. Meeting was held in the Brava theater in the heart of the Mission district, an overwhelmingly Latino neighborhood. There were a total of 37 people in attendance, including a number of youth and Latino immigrant rights activists. Jorge started the discussion with the latest development in Latin America including the mention of the revival of the fourth fleet of the U.S. Navy in charge of patrolling Latin America, the military and diplomatic incidents between Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador and the recent election of Fernando Lugo Mendez in Paraguay. He went on to mention the achievements of the Venezuelan revolution: the recent nationalizations of the cement industry, some industries in milk processing and meat cutting; the social programs enacted by Venezuela to end analphabetism and provide quality health care to working people; the experiences of worker’s control; as well as the enactment of the ALBA trading agreement between Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia. He also mentioned the problems facing the revolution such as the sabotage of food distribution chains, the bureaucracy left over from the fourth and fifth republics and the lack of decisiveness against the oligarchy. He mentioned that the revolution has only gone “half-way” and that it needs to push forward in order to establish socialism of the 21st century. He gave the example of one crossing the street and only walking half way, and pointed that obviously one cannot do that and sooner or later one would get run over by a vehicle. He said the Venezuelan revolution is in a similar situation. It will have to go all the way or it will be crushed. After his initial lead off, the floor was opened for questions and comments. The people present brought up a number of issues including the nationalization of the steel plant SIDOR, the situation in Colombia and the guerrillas, the changes in Cuba and the nature of the Venezuelan revolution.

													Hands Off Venezuela - Montreal"," On May 28th, close to 200 people attended a very successful conference on Cuba and Venezuela, entitled ""Cuba after Fidel, Venezuela at the Crossroads."" Hands off Venezuela Montreal and the Bolivarian Society of Quebec, in collaboration with the International Marxist Tendency and Gauche Socialiste, organized the event. Invited to speak were Celia Hart, Cuban Trotskyist, scientist, lecturer, and author; Jorge Martin, international secretary of Hands Off Venezuela; and Pierre Mouterde, Québec Solidaire member and author of works on Latin American and Quebec social movements. Notably among those attending were the Consul General of Cuba Sergio Vélez Camhi, Venezuelan Consul General Elio Vitriago, Venezuelan First Consul Adolfo Figueroa, and Bolivian Consul General Walter Estenssoro, as well as Amir Khadir, co-spokeperson of the left-wing party, Québec Solidaire. Ricardo Astudillo from the Quebec Bolivarian Society introduced the meeting and James Cockcroft chaired it. In his introduction, Cockcoft underlined the importance of the presentation of Leon Trotsky's book The Revolution Betrayed at this year's Havana Book Fair. This was the first major event in Montreal since Fidel's illness, discussing the political and social implications of what is currently happening in Cuba. Celia Hart led the discussion, as she is an active participant in the Cuban Revolution. In her presentation, Hart highlighted the fact that the Cuban and Venezuelan revolutions were mutually dependent and fed on each other, their relationship was different than the one that existed between the Soviet Union and its satellites. For instance, Cuba sends doctors to Venezuela while Venezuela provides Cuba with inexpensive oil, and a revolutionary spirit is shared between both countries. Cubans bring lessons of their revolution to Venezuela and vice versa. As the Cuban and Venezuelan revolutions are interlinked, the perspective put forward by Jorge Martin was crucial for this discussion to be complete. Despite the enormous gains made by the Venezuelan revolution, Jorge Martin emphasized that the revolution is still in danger. Recently, the US Navy has reformed the 4th fleet (which was disbanded in 1951) which is going to be patrolling the Caribbean and coasts of Latin America. This is combined with a noisy campaign to add Venezuela to the list of countries that the US accuses of ""sponsoring or harbouring"" terrorists. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, the oligarchy uses their control of key parts of the economy to organise a concerted campaign of sabotage, particularly of the food distribution chain. Jorge Martín explained how there is a bureaucracy within the Bolivarian movement which is standing in the way of the completion of Venezuela's revolution. Venezuela is at a crossroads, and the only way to move forward is to nationalize the economy, get rid of the capitalist state apparatus, and to set up a genuine revolutionary party capable of resolutely carrying the revolution through to its conclusion. ""You cannot make half a revolution anymore than you can half cross the street,"" Martin said. ""If you remain in the middle, you'll be crushed by oncoming traffic."" Also speaking was Pierre Mouterde who announced that Quebec Solidaire would be sending a delegation to Ecuador and Venezuela to learn from the revolutionary movement in those countries. After the speakers there was a lively debate with questions ranging from the situation in Cuba, to Colombia, Ecuador, May 68, etc. During the debate the meeting agreed with an ovation to send greetings to the Cuban Five who are jailed in US prisons, and who have also read Trotsky's books sent by the F Engels Foundation, as Celia explained. The audience, a mixture of young students, veteran activists and Latin American revolutionaries was clearly enthusiastic, not only about the unfolding revolution in Latin America but seeing that also as the prelude for revolutionary events worldwide. The meeting ended with a round of applause for the organisers and particularly for the excellent translation job done by Emerson Xavier da Silva, from the SBQ. The event has inspired closer collaboration between Hands Off Venezuela Montreal and the Bolivarian Society of Quebec. We look forward to future work toward common goals.

													Pablo Roldan, HOV London"," In spite of Manchester United and Chelsea playing a historical Champions League final at that very same time, over seventy people gathered on Wednesday, May 21, at London's Bolivar Hall for the opening of the film season Venezuela : a revolution in film , which is organised by Hands off Venezuela in association with the Venezuelan embassy in the UK. The season opened with the screening of the first part of ""The hour of the furnaces"" - Neo-colonialism and violence ‑ the opera prima of the legendary Grupo Cine Liberación, founded in the sixties by filmmakers Fernando ""Pino"" Solanas and Octavio Getino. As was pointed out in the introduction, the aim of the season is to deepen the understanding of the Bolivarian process within a wider historical, social, political, economic, and continental framework through the screening and debate of some cinematographic works of outstanding artistic and documentary value, such as ""The battle of Chile"", ""The hour of the furnaces"" or ""Memories of underdevelopment"", amongst others. José Baena, filmmaker ( Memories of a future ) and a habitual collaborator in the film magazine Vertigo , introduced ""The hour of the furnaces"" and spoke about the importance of the work pf the Grupo Cine Liberación. The screening was followed by a debate with Alan Woods, founding member of the Hands off Venezuela campaign , and author, amongst other works, of Reason in Revolt: Marxist philosophy and modern science , The Venezuelan revolution and his latest book Reformism or revolution: Marxism and 21 st Century socialism, whose Spanish edition is being presented in this year's June Madrid Book Fair . Alan Woods pointed out that Bolivar's ideas on the unification of Latin America, ""not the dream, because dreams have a rather unrealisable character, is not only possible, but necessary. However, this idea can only be materialised in the struggle for socialism. Can anyone think of a united Latin America while the oligarchs - the bankers, industrialists and landowners - keep holding political or economic power?"" he ended up asking. The season will continue with the screening of ""Memory of a plunder"" (Argentina, 2003) on the 18 th June. This work marked ""Pino"" Solanas' return to a cinema that was openly social and political. ""Memory of a plunder"" is an implacable chronicle and analysis of the devastating neo-liberal wave that hit Latin America throughout the nineties. A pesar de que a esa misma hora Manchester United y Chelsea se disputaban una final histórica de la Liga de Campeones, más de setenta personas asistieron miercoles, 21 de Mayo, en el Bolivar Hall de Londres a la inauguración del ciclo Venezuela: una revolución en cine. El ciclo, organizado por Manos fuera de Venezuela en asociación con la embajada venezolana en el Reino Unido, se abrió con la proyección de la primera parte de ""La hora de los hornos"" - Neocoloniaslismo y violencia ‑, opera prima del mítico Grupo Cine Liberación, fundado en los años sesenta por los cineastas Fernando ""Pino"" Solanas y Octavio Getino. El objeto de este ciclo, como se apuntó en la introducción, es ofrecer elementos para la comprensión del proceso bolivariano dentro de un amplio marco histórico, social, político, económico y continental a través de obras de indiscutible valor artístico y documental, como ""La batalla de Chile"", ""La hora de los hornos"" o ""Memorias del subdesarrollo"", entre otras. José Baena, director de cine ( Memorias de un futuro ) y colaborador habitual de la revista cinematográfica Vertigo¡ , introdujo el film y habló del trabajo del Grupo Cine Liberación. La proyección fue seguida por un debate con Alan Woods, miembro fundador de Manos fuera de Venezuela, y autor, entre otras obras, de Razón y revolución: filosofía marxista y ciencia moderna, La revolución venezolana o Reformismo o revolución: el marxismo y el socialismo del siglo XXI , su última libro, cuya edición en español se va a presentar este mes de junio en la Feria del Libro de Madrid. Alan Woods señaló que la idea de la unificación latinoamericana de Bolivar, ""no el sueño, porque los sueños suelen tener un carácter irrealizable, no es sólo posible, sino necesaria. Sin embargo, esta idea sólo puede materializarse en la lucha por el socialismo. ¿Alguien puede imaginar una América Latina unida mientras las oligarquías - los banqueros, los industriales, los terratenientes - sigan detentando el poder político o económico?"", acabó preguntando. El ciclo continuará con la proyección el próximo 18 de Junio de ""Memoria del saqueo"". Esta obra, que marcó el retorno de ""Pino"" Solanas al cine abiertamente social y político, es una crónica implacable de la ola neoliberal que en la década de los noventa azotó Latinoamérica. ",NA,NA

Some 70 people turned up for the event, with several trade unionists in attendance. Speaking on ""Revolutionary Latin America,"" Jorge was joined by Yasmin Tovar, a local Venezuela solidarity activist; August Nimtz, Professor at the University of Minnesota and expert on Cuba; and Gerardo Cajamarca, an exiled Colombian trade unionist now working with the United Steel Workers. Yasmin's opening comments on the importance of building solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution were enthusastically received, as were Professor Nimtz' remarks on the importance of the Cuban revolution in the broader context of the Latin American revolution. Gerardo, after explaning the political, military and paramilitary strategy of imposing a free trade agreement on Colombia, explained the need to go after the source of the problem right here in the U.S.: capitalism. Jorge Martin then gave an overview of the revolutionary process in Venezuela, which was also enthusiastically received. He explained how the main contradictions still facing the revolution are yet to be fully addressed: the question of the state, the economy, and the revolutionary leadership. He explained how the revival of the U.S. 4th Fleet, which was disbanded in 1950, responsible for patrolling Latin America and the Caribbean, is a clear example of the clear and present threat to the Latin American revolution.

													Mark Vorpahl, HOV Portland and Jennie Ernewein, HOV Canada"," Several activists from Hands Off Venezuela Canada traveled down to the United States to help out with the Jorge Martin speaking tour. Between May 6th and May 10th HOV held events in Portland Oregon, Olympia Washington and Victoria BC, before finishing up with the Western Canada HOV conference in Vancouver. It was a very successful tour which defended the Venezuelan revolution as well as laying the base for the formation of a number of HOV groups around the Pacific Northwest. Here are a selection of reports from the events: On May 6th, in Portland Oregon at Liberty Hall the Portland Central America Solidarity Committee (PCASC) hosted Jorge Martin, International Secretary of Hands Off Venezuela (HOV). Roughly 25 attendees listened attentively as Jorge described the beginnings of the Bolivarian Process, the leading the role of the masses in pushing it forward, the revolutions accomplishments and challenges, and some promising developments such as the recent nationalization of SIDOR and the growth of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) that can play an important role toward the winning of socialism. Questions ranged from Chavez's alleged ""cult of personality"", to the role of women in the revolution, the revolutions effect on Cuba, and the lessons we can draw from Venezuela's example for the struggles we face in North America. Many commented on how much they learned from Jorge's informed and articulate lecture and answers and the event has helped to excite local activists about the prospects of Venezuela solidarity work. After kicking off the Hands Off Venezuela West Coast Tour in Portland, Oregon, the next stop was Olympia, Washington. On Wednesday, May 7th there was two events in Olympia. The afternoon event was located at the South Puget Sound Community College. About 20 students and community members showed up and were receptive to supporting and organizing for HOV. The main organizers of the event were a student activist group called B.R.I.C.K. (Building Revolution through Increasing Community Knowledge). BRICK has experience with fighting for social justice through their participation in student walk-outs against the war in Iraq. The evening event was hosted at the Olympia Free School and approximately 30 people attended. A few professors from the Evergreen University had helped to organize this event and it was mostly their students who attended. There was great discussion and most people stayed over a half an hour asking Jorge questions. In fact a few people were leaving for Venezuela and were wanting to get more involved with the Bolivarian Revolution. The HOV campaign looks forward to future work with Olympia activists. On Thursday, May 8th the HOV Tour headed north again to Victoria B.C. There was a small gathering of people at the Camas Collective Bookshop. There was excellent discussion about the factory occupations under workers control. Jorge's talk on the Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution inspired the small audience to become active with HOV and they are now organizing to host a screening of No Volveran to continue this vital work of spreading the word!

			Antonio Betancourt’s speaking tour - Ten days that shook Sweden",2008-05-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Martin Lööf, Hands off Venezuela-Sweden"," For ten days Antonio Betancourt from Venezuela travelled the length and breadth of Sweden - from Luleå in the north to Malmö in the south. Antonio works at Inveval, a small company that produce valves for the oil industry. What is special about Inveval is that it is a company under workers' control. Antonio was invited by Hands off Venezuela (HOV) in Sweden and his tour has created a great deal of interest and enthusiasm for the HOV campaign. Beginning in December 2002 there was a two-month lockout of many workers in Venezuela. The bosses tried to sabotage the economy so that the people would put the blame on the government and force President Chavez out of office. This attempt to sabotage the economy failed because the people and especially the working class managed to keep production running. After the defeat of the lockout several companies continued to be closed. One of them was Inveval where the workers decided to occupy the factory. After a long struggle the company was nationalized under workers' control. Antonio spoke about how the leadership of the old trade union federation, CTV, supported the military coup against Chavez and the bosses' lockout. Because they betrayed the working class a new trade union federation, UNT, was created. But unfortunately it is paralysed by internal feuding. Sectarian leaders like Orlando Chirino are in conflict with reformists like Marcela Maspero. The UNT thus lacks a revolutionary leadership. Because the working class is not getting get a lead from its trade union leaders, Antonio and his comrades have founded FRETECO (the revolutionary front for factory occupations and workers' control). Through FRETECO those companies that are either occupied or are running under the control of workers work together. Their goal is a socialist Venezuela where workers' control will not be an exception but the norm. All big companies should be nationalized and run under workers' control. The members of FRETECO believe that because the working class produces everything in society they should rule and plan the economy. In FRETECO they fight not only against the capitalists and the right wing, but also against reformists and bureaucrats within the Bolivarian movement who stand in the way of a truly socialist Venezuela. The idea of launching FRETECO did not fall from the sky but was put forward by the Corriente Marxista Revolucionaria, which is a part of an international Marxist tendency (the International Marxist Tendency, IMT) and to which Antonio also belongs. The tour was made possible thanks to the economic contribution from a variety of organizations, mainly in the labour movement. We want to thank the Social Democratic PALME project group in Borlänge, the Left Party in Dalarna, Falun and Göteborg, the Left Students' Union in Stockholm, the Social Democratic Students' Union Demos, the Young Left in Stockholm and Malmö, the Social Democratic Youth League in Gävleborg, Skåne, and the Social Democratic Youth League Facken (Stockholm) and Centrum (Malmö), the Embassy of Venezuela in Sweden, the Latin America committee in Luleå, and Kvarnby people's high school. Many more organizations have been active in the organization of the meetings. Antonio spoke at public meetings in Luleå, Sandviken, Borlänge, Göteborg, Lund, Malmö, Växjö and Stockholm. Antonio also visited the Social Democratic Youth Leagues Gävleborg's Vantorp campsite, the Metalworkers' trade-union branch at SSAB (a big steel mill in Borlänge), he spoke at a meeting with over seventy nurses on strike in Gothenburg, visited Kvarnby people's high school in Malmö, spoke at the Left Party's First of May rally in Stockholm, and visited a warehouse in Jordbro. Antonio also visited the Young Left's Stockholm office, and had meetings with Eva Björklund, who is responsible for international affairs for the Left Party's executive committee, and Venezuelan ambassador Horacio Arteaga. In total we raised almost 3300 Euros (30,000 SEK) through contributions from organizations and collections at meetings. Our target was that Antionio should return to Venezuela with 5000 SEK after expenses. We managed to beat out target, Antonio could return with 11,700 SEK including a donation of 500 SEK from the Social Democratic Youth League in Sandviken and 2000 SEK from the Commercial Workers trade union branch at the Lagena warehouse. Throughout the whole tour Antonio gave the same message to whoever he met: the working class can run the factories, the working class should not only run the companies but the whole of society, not only in Venezuela but in the whole world, including Sweden. Antonio did not only speak about the revolution in Venezuela but also about the need for world revolution and an international planned economy. Some people who came and listened at the meetings were surprised to hear this message. At the same time for many it became clear that the ideas of socialism are alive and that a fundamental transformation of society is possible. Around seventy people have said that they are now interested in the campaign. We will now use the success of the speaking tour to strengthen the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Sweden. We will invite all those that are interested to join study groups about the Venezuelan revolution. We want to form a network of representatives of the campaign in more cities around the country. At the Left Party congress in June an amendment has been tabled that the Left Party should support the HOV campaign's appeal to the Swedish labour movement. The Party leadership says that it agrees with the demands of the appeal, but that it doesn't want to support a campaign that has been launched by the IMT! Comrades active in the HOV campaign will go to the congress to explain what the campaign is really about, and what the IMT is. At the European Social Forum in Malmö in September we will try to have a workshop about solidarity with Venezuela to gather everybody that is active in the campaign and people that want to become active. In November we plan to have our second national solidarity congress, but this time we aim to have double the number of participants. ",NA,NA

													Melanie MacDonald - HOV London"," The Latin America House in London screened No Volverán: The Venezuelan Revolution Now! last night at it's Cine Club. Sixteen people were present including the film makers (both Hands Off Venezuela members) who were there for the discussion afterwards. There was a lot of interest and fascination about how worker's control actually functioned at Sanatarios Maracay and other factories, a point of view of the revolution that is rarely covered. Everyone was sad to hear that the struggle at Sanitarios ended in defeat but the mood lightened up with news of the recent victories at Sidor. The group was updated on the latest external and internal threats facing Venezuela. Unfortunately, the list was long. First, the economic attack of US courts freezing 12 billion dollars worth of Venezuelan offshore assets in response to a petition by ExxonMobil. Then, the overt military posturing of the U.S. in it's reconstitution of the U.S. navy's Fourth Fleet. Effective July 1st 2008, U.S. aircraft carriers, battle ships and nuclear submarines will once again patrol the Caribbean, Central America and South America for reasons of 'security' and anti-narco trafficking. Something that hasn't happened since the cold war. Also, there is the possibility of a new U.S. military base being built in Colombia right on the border with Venezuela. This threat is in response to the Ecuador government of Raphael Correa - a close ally of Chávez - refusing to renew the agreement for a U.S. military base on Ecuadorian territory which is set to expire in 2009. Correa said ""We'll renew the base on one condition: that they let us put a base in Miami - an Ecuadorean base....If there's no problem having foreign soldiers on a country's soil, surely they'll let us have an Ecuadorean base in the United States."" He said. Then, most alarming was the surprise, unauthorized bomb attack by the Colombian military (Colombia is a client state of the U.S. and receives the most U.S. 'aid' funding second only to Israel) in Ecuador that killed 24 people including Raul Reyes one of the main FARC negotiators in hostage release talks with Venezuela. Then, inside Venezuela itself, there is the continued economic sabotage of the food industry by the internal opposition. Shortages of milk and sugar have been caused when owners of these businesses refuse to abide by government price controls (intended to make goods affordable to the poor) and practice hoarding, speculation and smuggling. All of this is to undermine the process of change taking place in Venezuela in a desperate attempt to keep Venezuela and the whole region, which is fantastically rich in oil and natural resources, in its usual semi-colonial state. There was also an interesting contribution from a young Venezuelan in the audience who seemed exasperated and frustrated with the pace of change taking place in her home country and sited several problems with bureaucracy and inefficiency. She hoped to do her best to participate in improving the situation when she returned home. Hands Off Venezuela would like to thank Jorge Rodriguez for organizing the screening. Latin America House is a place that aims to provide space and support for Latin Americans, Spanish and Portuguese speakers and local communities of Kilburn, where it is located. They offer help with legal issues, a chance of acquiring life-long skills and a place to meet people, share ideas and enjoy the rich culture of Latin America! We thank them for their warm welcome and hope to work with them more in the future. Please go to their website for more information and the up-coming program for their Cine Club. ",NA,NA

													Fairfax Culpepper, HOV Vancouver"," On May 9th-10th, Hands Off Venezuela held a two-day Western Canada Conference in Vancouver, BC. The event was opened Friday night by Tim Louis, HOV Canada's Honorary President. Louis, a former Vancouver City counselor and well-respected activist in the local left community, discussed the gains that the revolution has made for the working people of Venezuela and how we can take inspiration from this to do the same here in Canada. Next Jorge Martin, the International Secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign spoke about the current state of the revolution and its future. Lively discussion followed as audience members drew attention to similarities between the struggle in Venezuela and events in Canada. The conference kicked off the following day with a screening of the documentary No Volveran. Made during the 2006 presidential elections, this film explores through interviews with Venezuelans what the revolution means to them and includes a visit to a factory operating under workers' control. After a short break, participants re-convened for a panel discussion on Labour and the Solidarity Movement with speakers Jim Sinclair, president of the BC Federation of Labour, and Kevin Bell, an activist with the Retail Wholesale Union. Sinclair addressed what Canadian workers could do to support their sisters and brothers in Venezuela and the revolution - bring the lessons of the Venezuelan revolution to the Canadian labour movement. And Bell addressed concrete ways in which we could do this, focusing on the example of the recent factory occupations in Ontario and Quebec and calling for militant action by labour activists. During the discussion, strategies to promote Venezuela at the upcoming BC Federation of Labour Convention were discussed, especially after the Vancouver and District Labour Council has just passed a resolution to endorse HOV. The second panel discussion, and final event of the conference, was on the topic Socialism of the Twenty-first Century. Speakers Alex Grant, the Co-ordinator of HOV Canada and editor of Fightback magazine, Ian Beeching, an activist with Vancouver Socialist Forum and Antonio Ortiz from the Vancouver Bolivarian Society, discussed what exactly ""Twenty-first Century Socialism"" means. Beeching drew parallels between the socialism of this century with socialism of centuries past pointing out their similarities but cautioning that we need to learn from both the successes and failures of the past, especially in regards to bureaucratization. Grant focused on the necessity for the Venezuelan revolution to move forward and listen to the workers, poor and peasantry who wish to eradicate capitalism and not be derailed by the bureaucracy. And Ortiz discussed the differences between working for socialist revolution in Canada as opposed to Venezuela. Discussion was very animated as audience members further explored what socialism is and how it can be achieved. This discussion ended the conference on an upbeat note as people left feeling inspired and energetic. Overall the conference was a great success and brought together activists from various groups and traditions. About 70 different people attended the sessions over the 2 days. The example of the Venezuelan revolution is an incredibly inspiring one that brings with it the realization that a socialist revolution can happen in our country too. The HOV Western Canada Conference created an opportunity for dialogue about just how to do this which in turn created the inspiration to motivate participants to make it actually happen. HOV Canada wished a fond farewell to Jorge Martin, who left for a number of speaking dates in the USA. Luckily, he will be back in Canada May 28th and 29th, speaking in Montreal with Cuban revolutionary Celia Hart. Details to follow. ",NA,NA

													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela"," On May 12th, at the Niebyl-Proctor library in Oakland, the Venezuelan solidarity Network and San Francisco Hands off Venezuela, hosted Jorge Martin (International Secretary of Hands off Venezuela). Roughly 25 people attended mostly workers and activists, but also a good number of youth among the audience. The meeting was very spirited and one of the organizers was eager to continue having events in defense of the Bolivarian revolution. Martin spoke for more than an hour on the current state of the revolutionary processes of Venezuela. He began by highlighting the gains of the nationalizations of SIDOR, and the growth of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). One of the most important analyses of Martin is that the revolution is far from complete and the most urgent tasks are the role of the economy, the need for a revolutionary party and the role of the state. The weakest point is the divisive role the UNT has played in furthering the nationalization and in working with FRETECO. There were many questions and comments, including some accusations of Chavez being a populist, and the others questioning why the referendum was defeated. Martin explained that the reason people did not vote in support of the referendum was because they still not seen the revolution solve their most immediate needs such as food, clothing, or shelter. There are still many poor barrios in Venezuela where there is a lack of basic necessities. Martin explained that the revolution must go forward to meet the needs of the workers in order to advance their conditions. In relation to Chavez being the head of a populist government, Jorge stated that the Chavez is not a populist because the ruling class is not part of the government; on the contrary, many of oligarchic and foreign investors have fled Venezuela leaving workers in difficult circumstances with food shortages. He explained that a better term is to describe the process as a national democratic revolution moving towards socialism. He also explained that the new PSUV has adopted their ideology not only from Simon Bolivar, Miranda, Ezequiel Zamora, but as well as that of Marx, Engel’s, Lenin and Trotsky. Finally, Jorge explained, the best way to build solidarity with Venezuela is to fight for our own revolution here in the U.S, there was a loud hand of applause and enthusiastic and revolutionary spirits in the end.

This is an important victory for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign ahead of the Western Canada Conference this weekend. The Vancouver and District Labour Council has historically been behind every progressive movement in the city. Their support for the Bolivarian Revolution and the government of Hugo Chavez will go a long way to help educate workers about events unfolding in Venezuela. HOV is proud to welcome them to the campaign! BECAUSE Venezuela is playing a key role in the struggle for national sovereignty and control of natural resources in South America; and BECAUSE President Hugo Chavez may well be the most democratically elected leader in the world having won no less than nine electoral contests during the past six years; and BECAUSE the United States has chosen to treat the legitimate national aspirations of the people of Venezuela as a threat and the country of Venezuela as an enemy; and BECAUSE there is an international campaign in support of Venezuela called ""Hands Off Venezuela"" which is supported by the Ontario Federation of Labour, Alberta Federation of Labour and Labour Councils across the country. THE VANCOUVER & DISTRICT LABOUR COUNCIL WILL endorse and support the ""Hands Off Venezuela"" campaign. ",NA,NA

													Jesus Syaiful Anam - HOV Indonesia"," The launching of Hands Off Venezuela in Indonesia was received with great enthusiasm by many progressive elements. Attended by about 70 people, HOV Indonesia was launched in the LBH (Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation) building, Jakarta, on 28 March 2008. In addition to delegates from organisations which are involved in the national committee of HOV-Indonesia, such as Rumah Kiri, the PRP (Working People's Association), the SMI (Indonesian Students' Union), the IGJ (Institute for Global Justice), SERIAL (Indonesian People's Solidarity for Latin America), KPRM - PRD (The Political Committee of The Poor People's Democratic Party), the LMND - PRM (National Student League for Democracy - The Politics of the Poor), the KSM UNAS (Students' Study Group of the National University) , this event was also attended by delegations from the KMK (Organisations of Urban Poor), other groups who seek change in Indonesia, and individuals who are interested in the revolutionary process in Venezuela. The launch event was opened by a screening of No Volveran , a documentary about mass struggle in Venezuela to push the revolution forward. It was then followed by a discussion about Venezuela. Zely Ariane, HOV-Indonesia spokesperson, discussed the ideas of the new economy and new democracy by learning from the revolutionary process and socialist programs in Venezuela. Sadikin Gani from Rumah Kiri, who was a panellist for the discussion, emphasised the importance of an international movement in order to abolish capitalism. According to him, such a movement will succeed only if it is carried out throughout the globe. From the discussion, it was emphasised that the struggle of the Venezuelan masses and the political stand of President Chavez are the inspirations needed to develop revolutionary leadership and the forces of the revolutionary vanguard - and to arouse the class consciousness of the masses in Indonesia. This discussion was also a manifestation of the successful struggle of the poor, who have no access to power. The struggle of the Venezuelan people to organise themselves, build communities, take over factories, etc. - which are documented in the film No Volveran - can be an inspiration for the struggle for change in Indonesia. The contextualisation of the struggle in Venezuela becomes the most fundamental thing. Organising political education to develop the class consciousness of the Indonesian masses using the lessons of the Venezuelan revolution is a very effective tool. This requires continuous works, and Hands Off Venezuela-Indonesia has undertaken this revolutionary task. The discussion was ended with statements from organisations that were present to support this campaign. Several groups have readied themselves to hold a series of discussions amongst their own supporters, others will be monitoring and contributing to the HOV-Indonesia website. Another meeting will be held to plan future actions to build networks that can support the campaign on Venezuela as an inspiration for the building of a revolutionary movement in Indonesia.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," As part of their bi-monthly meeting, the Greater London Labour Representation Committee (LRC) invited the Hands Off Venezuela campaign to lead a discussion on the recent events that have taken place in Venezuela. The LRC, originally formed in 1900 to fight for political representation for the Labour Movement, was re-formed in 2004 to secure a voice for socialists within the trade unions, the Labour Party and Parliament. Will Roche from the HOV campaign gave a summary of events dating from the re-election of President Chavez in 2006, in particular, the development of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). The Party, with over 6 million members, including 285,000 housewives, 1.4 million laborers, and 745,000 professionals, held its founding congress earlier this year. 1,676 congress delegates debated a draft program which included subjects like; defence of the revolution, building socialism, building popular power, socialising power, planned economy, communal state, defence of nature, a state based on popular power, and internationalism. The speaker also described the extensive campaign of sabotage the right-wing opposition have been carrying out; in discrediting the constitutional reforms, in creating food shortages by refusing to supply produce, especially milk, the attempt to freeze millions of dollars of oil assets abroad by ExxonMobile, and the murderous activity of the Colombian government in assassinating members of the FARC whilst Chavez was negotiating the release of hostages. These are all parts of an overall concerted effort to de-stabilise and destroy the Venezuelan revolution. The Venezuelan government has responded in the best of ways by carrying out several nationalisations, of the electricity industry, of telecommunications, of the beef and milk industries, of the cement industry, and of steel production, bringing these key industries into public ownership and control. A vibrant discussion took place after Will’s update, with a variety of questions and contributions, especially on the subject of workers’ control. Gary Heather, the chair of the meeting and long standing member of the HOV campaign, expressed his support and congratulated the London HOV group on managing to meet weekly since the campaign was established over 4 years ago. The tasks facing the members of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, the struggle against bureaucracy, the struggle for a democratically elected and recallable leadership, and of the carrying out genuine socialist policies, is a struggle that is shared by workers world wide, none more so than by a great many members of the Labour Party here in Britain.

The resolution, H.Res. 1049, asks that the State Department place Venezuela on a list of countries that provide support to terrorist organizations, a designation that would impose a number of sanctions on Venezuela and U.S. companies that do business there.

													Henry Rees-Sheridan"," As an avid follower of current affairs, and having discovered my passion for Politics in the past year, seeing a poster up on the walls of my college advertising a speech on Venezuelan Socialism made me strangely excited. Despite my news-junkie status, I made my way to the college’s philosophy HQ (the site of the presentation) lacking knowledge of both the history of and the current political situation in Venezuela. This was all about to change. As it happened, my ignorance of Venezuela as a specific example of socialism coupled with my fairly sound knowledge of the political theory itself (thank you Marx For Beginners, and, to an alarmingly lesser extent, The Communist Manifesto) put me in the fortunate position of having a lot to gain from the talk. And it didn’t disappoint. Darrall Cozens’ informal but informative style of presentation left me feeling suitably enlightened on the topic, while being refreshingly different from most political lectures in that I was able to remain conscious throughout. Darrall was grilled by the students afterwards, and responded well to all their questions. The only criticism I could offer was that some big topics were skimped over slightly, something Darrall could barely be held responsible for given the tight time restrictions that had been placed on him. So, an excellent presentation, with some interesting points put forward by both Darrall and the students. Socialism is a strange beast; it is the system of the people, yet has been seen by some (myself included) to impede on civil liberties. The perceived failure of Eastern European Communism was inevitably brought up in discussion, and I’m sure Darrall and all those pro-Chavez in nature are sick of having Venezuela’s democratic government compared to the doomed programs of Iron Curtain era Europe. I think people need to learn to look at each example of socialism on its own merits, and from what I can gather from the various sources of information on the topic that are available, Chavez’s government that recently won it’s third successive general election landslide victory bears minimal resemblance to the dictatorial Eastern Bloc regimes that gained notoriety in the 20th century. In fact, it could be argued that socialism has never been more democratic as in modern-day Venezuela, making Chavez’s incumbent the most accountable of the Socialist governments to date. Another point brought up by Darrall that was questioned was the statement that “Socialism always crops up at the weakest points of Capitalism” (paraphrase). To me, this made Socialism sound like a compensation, its only place being in a society in which capitalism has already failed, and there is no other option. Darrall countered with a list of Chavez’s achievements; huge and effective investments in education, healthcare, and housing, coupled with the most explicitly socialistic of his policies in his effort to democratize the economy. The talk left me optimistic about the future of Venezuela and socialism. If Chavez can spot the faults in China’s system and avoid becoming too ‘Big Brother’ in his policies concerning individual liberties, he could find himself running amongst the most effective and ethical socialist state in the world. Wish him luck... ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela"," 25 April 2008 Dear Ambassador, The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign recognises that the social movements in Bolivia and the government of Evo Morales, which has the support of the overwhelming majority of the Bolivian people, are facing intense danger from the undemocratic opposition within the country, who are supported by imperialism, most notably that of the USA. We believe there are many parallels with developments in Venezuela. We recognise that the demands for ""autonomy"" for the departments of Santa Cruz, Pando, Tarija and Beni, far from being concerned with greater democracy, are an attempt by the oligarchy to keep control of the country's most valuable natural resources in their own hands. We also note with concern the racist tone of their campaign. Because of the national referendum on the Constitution and land reform on May 4 and also the illegitimate referendum on Santa Cruz ""autonomy"" on the same day, aimed at splitting the country, our members will be paying particular attention to events in Bolivia in the coming period. We have close contact with the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign and will be assisting them in all their efforts. We assure you that in the event of any attempt against the democratically-elected government of Bolivia we will assist the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign to expose the actions and motives of those responsible and mobilise public opinion.

			Young Left in Sweden passes motion on support for the Venezuelan Revolution and the HOV campaign",2008-03-27T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Martin Lööf, HOV Sweden"," This Easter Young Left had its 44 th congress in Arboga, Sweden. At the Congress activists from the Hands off Venezuela campaign were present arguing support for a motion that included a call for Young Left to support the campaign and sign an appeal to the Swedish labour movement. This appeal had earlier got support at district level in Young Left and the Young Socialists . The motion was passed against the will of the National Committee (NC). They had no political arguments against the motion instead they argued from a purely formalistic point of view that there was no tradition of supporting appeals at congress. At the congress several speakers, many of whom hadn't been involved in the Campaign before, spoke in favour of the motion. In the debate a speaker from the NC said that this was not about whether we supported the revolution or not. Some speakers said that the Young Left should have its own analysis. But the revolution is now 10 years old, Young Left have had time to develop an analysis and so far the activities of the Hands off Venezuela campaign had been a large part of the solidarity work for the revolution in Sweden. For many of the delegates this was a vote for the revolution. If you support the resolution why not support the most important solidarity campaign in favour of the revolution? A campaign that has got the support of President Chavez himself. The success of the Hands off Venezuela campaign is clearly not that we have a strong organisation it is because it is an international campaign that understands the development of the revolution, has an orientation to the labour movement and does serious solidarity work. This was a great success for the campaign. We will now use this decision to continue our work to get support, and to involve the Labour movement in Sweden in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. Here is the appeal that got support at the congress. Martin Lööf Hands off Venezuela Sweden ",NA,NA

This event was hosted by Hands Off Venezuela Montreal in coordination with UberCulture Collective Concordia. Alex Grant, the National Coordinator for HOV was brought in from Toronto to speak after the film and answer any questions people had. The movie was enthusiastically received by everyone. After the film, Alex Grant spoke about the Bolivarian Revolution and how it has been spreading across Latin America all the way up to Mexico, the doorstep of the United States. The discussion was engaging and interest in socialist ideas opposed to the capitalist system were expressed by many people in the room. Most people signed up to the HOV email list and many people expressed interest in getting involved in the campaign in Montreal. A handful of DVD's were sold to interested people along with some books, pamphlets and stickers about Venezuela and socialism. This event is a major step forward for Hands Off Venezuela in Montreal. This has been the most successful HOV event has ever organized in Montreal and we hope to organize many more in the future. Near the end of May in conjunction with La Société Bolivarienne du Québec, HOV Montreal are bringing the international secretary of the HOV campaign, Jorge Martin to Montreal and will be having a speaking event about the current situation in Venezuela.

			Hands Off Venezuela Campaign to be launched in Indonesia",2008-03-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ted Sprague"," It is not an overstatement that the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela is a shining beacon of hope for struggling masses around the world. Not only inspiring, the Venezuelan revolution offers many lessons for revolutionaries who are genuinely seeking radical solutions to problems faced by the toiling masses. With these ideas in mind, a group of Leftist organizations and individuals in Indonesia have decided to launch the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, thus making it the first HOV campaign present in the Asia Pacific region. The official launch of the campaign will be held in conjunction with the first public premiere screening of ""No Volveran"" on March 28, 2008. The campaign's website is already up and running and has served as a source of information on the Venezuelan Revolution. Local organizations that have supported and endorsed this campaign include the PRP (Working People Association), the KPRM-PRD (The Political Committee of The Poor - People's Democratic Party), SERIAL (Indonesian People Solidarity for Latin America), Rumah Kiri, Ultimus Bandung, Resist Book, SMI (Indonesian Students’ Union), IGJ (Institute for Global Justice), and LMND-PRM (National Student League for Democracy - The Politics of the Poor). Many other progressive groups are expected to join as the campaign becomes more and more established. This is how it was announced in the invitation letter to the launching event. For the movement in Indonesia, the fate and the lessons of the Venezuelan Revolution are crucial. Just as in Venezuela, Indonesia is rich in oil and yet 110 million of its 220-million population live on less than $2 a day, 13 million children in Indonesia go hungry for lack of food, and 25 million people are illiterate. Nationalization of oil (and other mining industries) as carried out by the Bolivarian government, where the profit is then distributed to the people through social programs, is one of the demands that can also be applied in Indonesia to tackle its dire poverty. The launching of the HOV campaign in Indonesia should be a cause for celebration for all revolutionaries around the globe. It symbolizes yet another concrete example of solidarity between the exploited masses in Indonesia and Venezuela, in Asia and Latin America. It is another step forward toward greater unity amongst all toiling masses in their struggle against global capitalism and imperialism.

			Joint meeting against imperialist intervention in Latin America",2008-03-17T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Rob Walsh - HOV"," A successful public meeting on the Latin American Revolution, organised jointly by four solidarity campaigns, was held in Central London following the Stop the War rally on Saturday 15 March. The meeting had been called by Hands Off Venezuela, Colombia Solidarity Campaign, the Movement of Ecuadorians in the UK and the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign, as a response to the military incursion launched by the Uribe government of Colombia against Ecuador and the renewed threat of imperialism. About 70 people packed the meeting room and heard speakers from the different campaigns describe how the struggle of workers and peasants in Latin America for a better society is opposed fiercely by imperialism and the few hundred wealthy families who control the economy and dominate the privately-owned media in these countries. Fidel from Movimiento Ecuador Reino Unido (Movement of Ecuadoreans in the UK) explained how the people of Ecuador are very good at said at getting rid of bad presidents, but up until now have not been very good at getting a good one in. He explained the different steps through which Rafael Correa came to power against the opposition of all traditional parties, the oligarchy and the media. Jorge Martin from Hands Off Venezuela, explained the latest threats of imperialism against the Bolivarian revolution: Exxon's legal case against PDVSA, the attempt by Bush to list Venezuela as a ""terrorist"" country and the on-going campaign of sabotage of the economy on the part of the oligarchy. He also made an appraisal of the recent congress of the newly formed PSUV, in which the revolutionary democratic spirit of the Bolivarian rank and file had made itself heard loudly, despite attempts of the bureaucracy to silence it. He warned that the 100 families which compose the oligarchy have largely lost political power but still have economic power. The other danger which faces the revolution, he said, is the internal bureaucracy and the right wing of the Bolivarian movement who block the revolutionary initiative of the people and many times the rulings of the president himself. Andy Higginbottom and Juan Gabriel from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign spoke next. Andy started by explaining how two activists had been detained by the police during the Stop the War demo just for chalking slogans on a building. He then went on to explain that the right wing government of Uribe in Colombia was groomed as imperialism's staunchest ally. Uribe himself was educated in Harvard and Oxford. Juan Gabriel gave a detailed explanation of the mood of fear and intimidation which prevails in Colombia against any form of left wing activity. He gave examples of how bosses gave their workers time off to attend the February 4 th demonstrations against the FARC organised by the government and the right wing, while 4 of the organisers of the March 6 th demonstrations against paramilitarism and violence had been shot dead. Amancay Colque from Bolivia Solidarity Campaign also spoke explaining how the issue of ""autonomy"" which had been raised in Santa Cruz and other provinces was used by the right wing in order to undermine the Evo Morales government but above all to keep control over the rich gas and oil fields in this region. She also explained the limitations of the Constituent Assembly and how the oligarchy used also the issue of the capital city to divert attention from the main point which was land reform. During the discussion a number of very good points were made. For instance the issue of coal mining in Zulia, which would negatively impact the livelihoods of indigenous communities was one which showed the contradiction between Chavez and the bureaucrats on the ground which had links with the coal multinationals. In response to this Jorge Martin also mentioned the SIDOR steel workers strike which had been repressed by the National Guard. There was also discussion about the issue of narco-trafficking which Andy Higginbottom explained is clearly linked to the interests of the ruling class in Colombia. A common thread of the discussion was that we should not forget that the multinationals which are exploiting these countries are based in Europe and the US, so it was not just solidarity which was required but also a struggle against the system that creates these conditions. Jorge Martin made the point that the struggle for socialism should not only take place in Latin America but also in Britain. At the end a collection was made that covered cost of the meeting room. There was a general feeling that the meeting had been a good example of cooperation between the different solidarity campaigns, something that needed to continue in the future.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," SOLIDARITY campaigners protested in central London on Wednesday night against ExxonMobil's successful attempt to freeze Venezuelan assets as part of a compensation dispute. After gathering outside an office block owned by the oil giant's British subsidiary Esso, the 20-plus protesters marched to the Royal Courts of Justice, where ExxonMobil had been granted the assets freeze and where the case was to be continued on the following Friday and Wednesday. ExxonMobil has launched a $36 billion (£18.5bn) lawsuit against Venezuela and has won court orders in Britain, the Netherlands and the US to freeze up to $12 billion (£6.1bn) of assets. Venezuela has responded by stopping oil sales to the company, accusing it of ""judicial terrorism"" and acting as ""a spearhead for imperialism."" A spokesman for Hands Off Venezuela, which organised the protest, called ExxonMobil's position ""provocative and dangerous"" and added that ""it's common knowledge that Exxon is the power behind George Bush, who has made overthrowing Hugo Chavez his top priority before leaving office."" The spokesman promised that the campaign ""will continue to put pressure on ExxonMobil and the British courts to end this legal circus and send a message to the company that it's time to get its hands off Venezuela's oil.""

													Ed Doveton"," On Tuesday 5th February the Manchester Hands off Venezuela held a successful meeting with over 60 people attending. The meeting was held jointly with the Green Party of Manchester to raise awareness of Venezuela, discuss the revolutionary situation and look at changes and developments in the country and more widely in South America as a whole. There were two speakers, Edenis Guilarte a popular educator from Venezuela and Darrall Cozens, from HoV. Edenis, using a PowerPoint presentation looked at the developing examples of communities of working class people taking power into their own hands at a local level; planning housing developments and determining resources for the community. Darrall spoke about the recent referendum and the need to move forward to socialist change, taking away power of the old state bureaucracy and economic power of the capitalist class. “The gains that have been made can still be lost, if the control of the state and the economy remains in the hands of capital.” This idea, along with what we could do in the UK, was taken up by the audience in the discussion. The overwhelming consensus of the meeting, including many individuals from the Green Party, was that the biggest help the UK could give to the revolution in Venezuela was to work for a socialist revolutionary change in Britain. At the end of the meeting a variety of people agreed to continue the work of this successful meeting by building the work of HoV in Manchester.

			Successful First Hands off Venezuela meeting in Norwich city centre",2008-03-17T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Norwich"," After the PSUV founding congress, the Venezuelan revolution is back on the agenda. This is even more important than ever considering the current world economic turmoil and the uncertainty surrounding Cuba's future since Castro announced he was not standing for president. With this exciting backdrop, Jorge Martin, international secretary of the Hands off Venezuela campaign, spoke in Norwich city centre on the topic Cuba and the Bolivarian Revolution . We in Norwich considered ourselves extremely fortunate to host Jorge on this topic, as not only is it big news in the labour movement (and the country as a whole), but Jorge has only just returned from Cuba, being there during Castro's announcement. This, and our recent passing of a motion of affiliation to Hands off Venezuela at UEA, was the perfect backdrop for our first meeting in Norwich city centre. In organising this meeting, we have been working closely with some members of an independent Venezuela solidarity group in Norwich. Our combined efforts drew a crowd of 60, many of whom we had never seen before at meetings. Jorge spoke for over 30 minutes, mainly outlining the situation in Cuba: the spirited popular defence of the gains of the revolution, but also the constant undermining of these gains through the loss of its relationship with the USSR, the economic embargo and the relentless pressures of the world market. Jorge explained that in seeking a way out of this crisis, 80-90% of Cubans reject the idea of capitalism. However, the ‘Chinese way', which is really more or less disguised capitalism, holds a certain attractive pull because of its economic boom, amongst a section in the leadership. But Jorge warned against this illusion - China is not a model of socialism, but rather capitalism, and has only been able to achieve such growth because of its enormous size, and nevertheless remains at the whim of the world market, a world market now on the verge of recession. He finished off his speech in reference to Venezuela, speaking of its rejuvenating effect all over Latin America, and that we ourselves must learn a thing or two from the revolutionary movements in Latin America, as they represent the only possible future for humanity. Jorge's speech received possibly the warmest response from any meeting we have held here. The discussion lasted another 30 minutes, with contributions and questions on the future leadership of the Latin American left post Castro, the PSUV congress, Cuba's level of democracy in comparison to Britain's, and the recent situation with Colombian and US imperialism. One of the advantages in holding meetings in town is that most of your audience are not students, and have some money to donate! When we hold meetings on campus, even big ones, we often struggle to pay the speaker's expenses. But tonight we were able to not only cover these costs but also pay for the venue, as well as selling a good amount of literature and DVDs. Following the meeting quite a crowd headed down to the pub to discuss further. There is now the possibility of working closer on the independent Venezuela solidarity group, and to follow up this meeting in town with more in order to build on our contacts. What is certain is that following our successful motion to affiliate UEA students union with Hands off Venezuela , the campaign here will not go away. ",NA,NA

			Change and Struggle in Latin America Meeting at Leeds University",2008-02-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ben Curry"," On Thursday 7th February, having recently returned from a speaking tour of Latin America, Darrall Cozens visited Leeds University to share his experiences with more than 20 students and “Hands off Venezuela!” activists. Darrall began by explaining the conditions which have defined every revolution in history: the ruling class becomes divided and enters into crisis, unable to see a way forward; the middle class goes through a state of ferment; and finally the workers and the poor enter the political arena, determined to change their conditions. He went on to describe how for the past 9 years Venezuelan workers have struggled tirelessly to take their destinies into their own hands, seeing in Chavez the embodiment of their ambitions. Despite this Darrall noted how millions of Chavez supporters and PSUV members had simply stayed at home during the constitutional referendum. On the one hand he pointed to the existence of a “Fifth Column” in the Bolivarian movement – a bureaucracy which pays lip-service to “Socialism of the 21st Century” whilst actively sabotaging the “Si” campaign by removing any political content from it – and the abstention of thousands of workers who have become demoralised by the economic sabotage of the capitalists and landlords. Following the talk was a discussion which was marked by a high political level and a focus on what we, as socialists, can do to participate in the revolutionary process. One student, who had recently travelled to Bolivia, spoke about her experience talking to miners. She described how entire generations died in their twenties and thirties, under the rock face, for the profits of a few multinational companies. As a western tourist she explained how the only charity she could offer was to buy the workers dynamite so that they could continue to mine the rocks, whilst their health deteriorated under intolerable conditions. Everyone present agreed that the only way to support the Venezuelan Revolution was to struggle for a revolutionary transformation of British society. The discussion continued for a long time after the meeting had ended, with a number of eager students asking how they could join and get involved in Hands off Venezuela.

The screening was organized by the London Latin American Canadian Solidarity Association (LACASA), at the local rep cinema, Hyland Cinemas. Approximately 40 people came out to the event, despite it being in the middle of a snow storm. The film was incredibly well received and a strong majority of people in attendance stayed for the subsequent discussion. Luis Granados Ceja from HOV spoke on the revolutionary consciousness of the Venezuelan masses and the importance of workers' control, while Alex Grant dealt with what was on everyone's mind, the referendum result. There were several profound political questions from the audience, which speaks to the effect the Venezuelan revolution is having on sectors abroad. Ticket sales and sales of the No Volverán DVD were strong, with several showing interest in screening more documentaries in the future. This trip served to solidify links with London activists who expressed interest in more collaboration with HOV, and specifically invited us to participate in the London Social Forum next summer.

													Fairfax Culpepper, HOV Vancouver"," Last week's Hands Off Venezuela forum here in Vancouver was a great success. Over 60 people came out to hear Carmen Vina, Advisor to the Venezuelan Minister of Labour, and Mike Palecek, the Western Canada HOV campaign coordinator, discuss the recent defeat of the constitutional referendum. Vina provided some context for the ""no"" vote and explained some of the reasons many Venezuelans abstained from voting, in particular the fear based, anti-Chavez campaign. Palecek spoke to the lack of a concrete response from some sections of the Venezuelan government to the opposition's ""no"" campaign and pointed out that after many years of struggle people want to see a decisive shift in the economic basis of society. Both speakers were well received and the discussion period after they spoke was very lively. The questions being asked reflected a continuing interest in the Venezuelan revolution and its potential lessons for activists in other countries, such as Canada. A handsome donation was collected and sales of the No Volveran DVD and the FRETECO booklet were quite good.

													Charley Allan, Morning Star","A report from last night's weekly HOV-London meeting with Bolivian ambassador for trade and integration Pablo Solon, organised by the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign. HOV-London meeting(Morning Star , Friday December 14 2007) Bolivian opposition tactics could split the country, writes Charley Allan. BOLIVIAN ambassador for trade and integration Pablo Solon issued a stark warning to solidarity campaigners on Wednesday night that his country 'stands at the door to civil war.' Speaking at the National Union of Journalists headquarters in London during a tour of European capitals, he added that the situation was 'critical' as four state governors opposed to President Evo Morales have announced that they are declaring regional autonomy from Saturday. 'We're not against autonomy, autonomy is good, but there must be limits. We can't have two armies in one country or two foreign policies or two currencies,' Mr Solon insisted. Explaining the background to the conflict, he pointed out that, 'when Evo Morales was elected, there were several demands, including the nationalisation of gas and oil and an end to water privatisation.' 'But another demand was for a constitutional assembly to write a new constitution because the present one doesn't recognise the rights of the indigenous population, who make up the majority.' However, this assembly was effectively 'kidnapped' by right-wing politicians who would only discuss moving the parliamentary capital to the city of Sucre, near the resource-rich eastern region of Santa Cruz, according to Mr Solon, who added that this idea would be simply 'impossible' - if only because of the massive expense involved. Santa Cruz is spearheading a separatist movement that is threatening to 'split the nation.' Last Sunday, the assembly approved a final text, which will now be voted on in a national referendum. As well as attempting to 'blockade' this process, the opposition is also organising acts of violence, with small groups of 'fascist youth' attacking the social movements and the police, facilitating prison break-outs and even burning down houses of pro-government governors. Mr Solon explained that their objective is to 'provoke violence by the state so that Evo Morales would be seen as a dictator.' HOV-London meeting However, the president seems to have outmanoeuvred his enemies by calling for a recall referendum against himself and the governors of all nine states, 'so that the people of Bolivia can choose.' Bolivian ambassador to London Maria Beatriz Souviron revealed that the British Foreign Office had recently organised a meeting in Parliament with opponents of President Morales, even introducing them to journalists. 'The opposition will try to stop us any way they can, by manipulating the media, telling lies, even kidnapping and beating people,' she stormed. Mr Solon explained that the reason for his visit was to raise awareness and support among parliamentarians, trade unionists and grass-roots activists. Left Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn tabled an early day motion on Wednesday which declared 'strong support for the Morales government' as well as 'rejecting all attempts to violate the government's stability.' Wrapping up, Bolivia Solidarity Campaign spokeswoman Amancay Colque announced that this Sunday is the European day of action for Bolivia, with a rally taking place in Trafalgar Square featuring speeches alongside traditional music and dancing.",NA,NA

We sang specially written carols, ('Violent Night' etc) beat out rhythms and leafleted thousands of Christmas shoppers passing by the corporation's UK offices in Queen Caroline Street, Hammersmith, London W6. Despite sustained efforts to negotiate a just and decent solution for threatened Coca-Cola workers, in September year long negotiations between SINALTRAINAL and Coca-Cola broke down, and the union most affected has called for a re-launch of the international campaign of public mobilisation to protect its members lives.

Rally this Wednesday February 20th, 5pm-6.30pm 3 Clements Inn WC2, nearest Tubes: Temple, Holborn ExxonMobil, or Esso as it's known in Britain, is the world's biggest oil company and the second-largest corporation on the planet. It has made vast profits by exploiting people and land, displacing communities and contributing massively to global warming - which it denies is a problem - and is known as ""the power behind George W Bush."" When Hugo Chávez was elected president of Venezuela nine years ago, he promised a shake-up of the oil industry to give the state a fairer share of the vast revenues. He has nationalised projects in the Orinoco basin, which has more oil than the whole of Saudi Arabia, giving multinationals a minority share. Almost all the oil companies have agreed to the new terms - but not ExxonMobil. In the past few days, British, Dutch and US courts have accepted a compensation claim by ExxonMobil and frozen up to £12 billion worth of Venezuela's assets. Chávez responded by cutting off all oil supplies to the company and has publicly talked about stopping the flow to the US completely. The situation could easily escalate in an attempt to isolate and destabilise Venezuela - after all, George Bush has made overthrowing Chávez his number one priority before he leaves office. Hands Off Venezuela is calling for all supporters to protest against ExxonMobil's provocative actions and tell them: Hands off Venezuela's oil!

													Hands Off Venezuela London"," Dear supporters, As you know, Venezuelans go to the polls this Sunday (2nd December) to vote on whether to approve the new constitutional reforms. For many months, there have been rumours that the local elite and the US government might launch some kind of coup attempt around this time, using sabotage and propaganda as a cover for direct intervention. This week, a CIA memo has been discovered that confirms the existence of just such a plan, which is code-named Operation Pliers. It details the tactics that are being used, which include provoking violent uprisings and refusing to accept the referendum result to working closely with international news agencies and preparing the ground for military invasion from Colombia or the island of Curaçao (respectively referred to in the memo as the ""green"" and ""blue"" countries). Eva Golinger has written about this revelation at http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2914 It will undoubtedly be more difficult for the US to carry out this plan now that it has been exposed. However, the dangers are still very great and we are asking all supporters to be ever-more vigilant as Sunday approaches. According to the plan, the three or four days following the vote are especially critical. If it looks like they are getting away with their accusations of fraud and Chávez is seen to be isolated internationally, the opposition will be encouraged to escalate the violence up to the point where the US military might step in. On Sunday itself, we will be rallying against the CIA coup attempt outside Bolivar Hall, where the Venezuelan community in London will be voting, from 5pm once the poll has closed. We invite every supporter of the Bolivarian Revolution to join us but ask that everyone remain calm and polite when confronted or provoked by anti-Chávez Venezuelan voters, who would love nothing better than to engage us in conflict. The address of Bolivar Hall is 56 Grafton Way (off Tottenham Court Road) W1, nearest Tube: Goodge Street. Please bring banners and musical instruments if you have any - and wear red!

			No Volverán in Ireland",2007-12-10T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Melanie MacDonald"," Dublin Hands Off Venezuela Ireland organized screenings of the film 'No Volverán: The Venezuelan Revolution Now' in Dublin (November 26th) and in Belfast (November 27th) and invited me, as one of the filmmakers, along to participate in the after-film discussion. The first show was at the New Theatre in Connolly Books in Temple Bar, Dublin, a lovely little theatre at which twenty were present. As you made your way to the theatre in the back of the shop, you walked past a wide range of left-wing books, past posters of Karl Marx, Irish trade unionist James Larkin and of course, the bookshop's namesake James Connolly, the great Irish Marxist and revolutionary who helped lead the 1916 Easter Rising. Dáithí from Hands Off Venezuela Ireland and èirígí, introduced the film and chaired the discussion afterward. He said how important he thought events in Venezuela were and that he considered the film an important continuation of information from previous films like 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised' and 'Venezuela Bolivariana'. The discussion mostly revolved around the latest developments in Venezuela and the status of the factory Sanitarios Maracay. The up-coming constitutional reform was a big topic as well. One audience member commented that perhaps the film was overly positive and lacked representation of those critical of the Venezuelan process. I answered that in the current atmosphere of mostly negative and distorted media coverage of the Venezuelan revolution, it was an important and truthful position to defend as it was based on the true balance of forces on the ground. When we were there filming, the majority of people we met were overwhelmingly in favour of the revolution and the film features their point of view, said in their own words. After so many defeats for the opposition, like the defeat of the 2002 coup, the oil lockout, the recall referendum and the presidential elections we found that those against the revolution were relatively small in number, unorganized and based their hysterical opposition on outright lies easily proven to be false if one took a moment to look. Another audience member agreed with me and added that the bias is reflected in the choice of the majority of Venezuelans in over 12 electoral processes and so it should be dominant. The negative should not be ignored but its proportion should be considered. To over emphasize it, as so many in the mainstream media do, would actually be a terrible misrepresentation of the facts. Belfast The next screening was in Belfast at The Felon's Club. Prior to the screening, Ciarán and Pádreig, members of the James Connolly Debating Society, gave me a tour of the once battle-torn Belfast, the scene of much sectarian conflict between its loyalist and republican populations. The in-depth knowledge of my guides made it a journey through time, where bombings, assassinations and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the period known as 'The Troubles'. We went to the graveyard where the graves of the dead of the republican movement were laiden with green, white and orange flowers and flags. The Irish Republican History Museum, the commemorative monuments and the many murals depicted the events of the Easter Rising, the fight for workers' rights and the martyrs and political prisoners fighting for national liberation. These were all linked up to the international struggle for liberation with a string of massive murals on the 'International wall'. Here, again, the discussion after the screening revealed a keen interest and enthusiasm for events taking place in Venezuela. Many topics were covered like the role of the Venezuelan military and whether it can play a progressive role unless it is controlled by the population. And finally, the lessons to be learned for us here in Europe were discussed. Several people congratulated the film-makers for the film and said they were inspired to see the struggle for workers' control and the building of communal councils in Venezuela's bid for the transfer of wealth and power from the rich, elite minority to the vast majority of poor Venezuelans.

													John McDonnell MP and Jeremy Dear"," Wednesday November 7 2007 Dear sisters and brothers, As joint presidents of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, we are writing about some concerns that we have regarding the solidarity movement in Britain. Above all, we are concerned about the current relationship between HOV and the Venezuela Information Centre. This concern has deepened recently given the embarrassing clash of meetings at this year's TUC conference and the confusion and harm to solidarity work that this has caused. Our campaign was established in 2002 after the coup against President Chávez with the aim of mobilising solidarity for Venezuela's peaceful and democratic revolution. With few resources, we have managed to raise the profile of Venezuela in the trade unions, in Parliament and among activists and young people. Our successful work was instrumental in a motion, sponsored by Natfhe, being passed at the TUC in September 2005. Hugo Chávez has publicly thanked HOV both in Venezuela and on his visit to London. Prior to this visit, Chávez spoke at a rally of 5,000 supporters organised by the HOV campaign in Vienna. We discovered in early 2005 that another Venezuela solidarity organisation - the Venezuela Information Centre - was being set up. Although we welcomed this new group as an ally in the defence of Venezuela, we were alarmed to hear that VIC had organised a solidarity conference on the same day as our 2005 national conference, which we had invited them to speak at. We wrote to VIC urging cooperation in the future but unfortunately we received no reply. In the lead-up to the 2006 TUC conference, we wrote to VIC proposing ""an urgent meeting between HOV and VIC, and anyone else interested in the solidarity work, to see how we can best work together."" Once again we heard nothing. We were shocked to discover shortly afterwards at the Labour Party conference that there was a further clash of meetings between HOV and VIC. When we heard about this clash, we wrote to VIC offering to cancel our meeting in favour of a joint meeting but were informed that this was not possible. Further embarrassment was caused by the clash of meetings at this year's TUC. And another clash was only averted at this year's Labour Party conference when, after receiving no reply from VIC about a joint solidarity meeting, we decided to cancel our meeting. This situation cannot continue and we would like your help in resolving this state of affairs. We need cooperation to prevent needless competition, duplication and rivalry. We wish VIC well in its solidarity work and we are willing to take whatever measures are necessary to secure a meaningful collaboration - after all, some 14 national trade unions are official supporters of both HOV and VIC. We appeal to these unions to intervene and create some ground rules acceptable to all. For example, we believe that joint meetings should be held at the TUC and Labour Party conferences, as well as at national trade union conferences. To have two separate campaigns holding competing events at these occasions is simply counterproductive. The TUC and national unions have sponsored successful Latin American meetings, where all the solidarity organisations have been invited, have had stalls and have been asked to supply speakers. Why cannot the solidarity work on Venezuela be organised on similar lines by other parts of the labour movement, especially at the Labour Party conference? To secure this end, we are writing to you and the general secretaries of all trade unions that support both organisations to intercede and call a meeting to resolve these difficulties and lay the framework for fruitful solidarity in the future. If you would like to discuss this matter in more detail, please don't hesitate to contact us.

They gave an eyewitness account of community organizations in Venezuela and how towards the end of the campaign there appeared to be trouble. The PSUV was not well organized for the referendum, there was no canvassing and the trade unions were not visible as part of the campaign, despite the call for a 36 hour week. Following on, Maria Paez Victor from the Bolivarian Circle Louis Riel presented a balance sheet of the referendum. On the positive side almost half of the electorate supported socialism, despite years of scare-mongering propaganda. The opposition was forced to recognise the democratic nature of the referendum and in some ways this has disorganized their destabilisation plans. On the negative side Maria highlighted that complacency and terrible communication about the content of the reforms hampered the no side. There was a virulent campaign of lies and fear, funded by millions of dollars from the USA, combined with food sabotage. Significantly, a section of the State bureaucracy and regional governors were opposed to the reforms and hampered the campaign. Maria concluded her remarks by saying no to reconciliation with the opposition, that the community councils must be front and centre, and that there are only two projects in Venezuela - a socialist project and a capitalist project. Nicholas Lopez, of the Manuelita Saenz Bolivarian Circle , spoke about the type of socialism that Venezuela is trying to build with the ""5-motors"" of popular power. Nicholas said that socialism needs social ownership, a redistribution of wealth and the political organization of the people. Nicholas raised the issue of how the constitutional reforms may be re-introduced through 15% of the population signing a petition and how people need to become socialist in all their actions. The ""rotten apples"" need to be removed from the movement and socialism cannot come by decree. He concluded by saying that the PSUV and communal power needs to be the driving force of the revolution. The last speaker was Alex Grant of Hands Off Venezuela . Alex opened his remarks by talking about the international significance of the Venezuelan revolution and that as internationalists, every victory for the Venezuelan workers is a victory for workers in Canada and worldwide, the same too for every defeat. Therefore, the Venezuelan revolution is ""our"" revolution and nobody should hold back in discussing the way forward for the movement. Alex stated that there were two explanations for the defeat, either the revolution had gone too far and scared people off, or had not gone far enough in eradicating capitalism and tiredness was creeping in. Echoing the comments of the previous speakers, Alex mentioned how the fear-mongering campaign of the opposition which stated that Chavez would steal, ""your house, your car and your child"" was never sufficiently answered by the Bolivarian bureaucracy. Many Venezuelan activists are now taking up the call for a revolution within the revolution to kick out the elements that put on a red shirt and a red hat, but are still supporting the old capitalist state. Any conciliation with the opposition would be a disaster and lead to apathy amongst the mass of the population. At 9-years old, the revolution is probably the longest in history, but up until now the oil boom has meant that the government has been able to give real reforms without fundamentally altering the economic base of society. With the food sabotage by the oligarchy this stage has reached its limit and the only way to get milk back on the shelves is either through the capitalist measure of removing the price controls or the socialist measure of expropriating the hoarders and saboteurs under control of the food workers. Alex concluded by re-iterating the international significance of the Venezuelan revolution and how Canadian workers could learn much from Venezuela. Workers fighting the undemocratic bureaucracy in their own unions and parties can look to Venezuela. Manufacturing workers facing plan closures could learn from Venezuelan plant occupations and nationalizations. He stated that the best way to defend the Venezuelan Revolution is to build the conditions for revolution in our own countries and called on all those present to get active in the movement. A spirited question and answer session and collection was held after the main presentations. The issue of the need to work together and organize to counter media lies was a prominent theme and all agreed that while the referendum was a defeat, it is one that the movement can move forward from strengthened.

Over one hundred people turned out to see this spectacular film, some of which had never heard of the Venezuelan revolution before. The film was very well received and when it finished, was greeted with much applause and almost an hour of questions and discussion on the Venezuelan revolution, workers control, the constitution and the basic ideas of socialism. Having the opportunity to talk to various people after the question and discussion session it became obvious that the focus on workers control had caused people to begin to think about how capitalism really works and how it is possible to do without oppressive bosses. Many people signed up to Hands Off Venezuela, purchased a copy of the DVD, and expressed their desire to engage in further activities.

													Charley Allan"," LEFTWING lawmakers in Britain are urging their government to ""improve diplomatic relations"" with Venezuela after Labour MP John McDonnell raised a parliamentary motion on the subject of constitutional reform. The Early Day Motion (EDM) welcomes ""the advances made by the Venezuelan people since the election of President Chávez in 1998, particularly in the fields of healthcare, education, land reform and redistribution of wealth"" before recognising that ""the groundwork for these advances was laid by the adoption of the 1999 constitution."" It then ""applauds President Chávez and his government for seeking to reform this constitution in an open and democratic way, with the maximum involvement of the Venezuelan people."" An EDM, although not legally binding, is an effective way of raising awareness among Members of Parliament and gauging support on a particular issue. All MPs are invited to add their names, thereby signing a de facto parliamentary petition. Mr McDonnell tabled the motion, which is number 286 in the current session, with the backing of five other MPs, including Jeremy Corbyn, who is secretary of the British-Venezuela All-Party Parliamentary Group. Mr McDonnell is joint president of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and was the first MP to raise a motion in solidarity with the Chávez government. Referring to reports and rumours of sabotage, destabilisation and possible coup attempts in Venezuela, the motion ""condemns any interference with this peaceful and democratic process in the lead-up to a referendum on 2nd December, particularly from the country's old elite and their allies in the US Administration."" Crucially, it ""calls on the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to pledge their support for the progressive initiatives of President Chávez's government and attempt to improve diplomatic relations, which deteriorated rapidly after the UK Government's tacit support of the failed 2002 coup.""

			First national meeting of Hands Off Venezuela - Sweden",2007-11-15T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Martin Lööf - HOV Sweden"," On Saturday the 10th of November, Hands off Venezuela Sweden had its first national meeting. During the year the campaign has started to develop into a national campaign. The reason for this meeting was to gather those that are already active or want to become active in the campaign and other people in Sweden that are active in the solidarity movement for Venezuela and to make the campaign to function more effectively. One of the reasons for the meeting was to work as a stepping-stone towards a bigger conference next year were more people from the Swedish labour movement can participate. During the day more than 50 people from 4 different cities attended the meeting and more arrived for the fundraising party for the Venezuelan Revolutionary Front of Occupied Factories (FRETECO) in the evening. Several visitors commented that a large part of the audience were youth. That this was an important meeting could be seen in the guests that decided to participate. Among the delegates were Francisco Contreras, from the national leadership of the Left Party and Jose ""Cheo"" Sanchez, leading representative for Resolver (Venezuelan solidarity network) which has played an import part in the solidarity movement for Venezuela in Sweden. We want to express our special gratitude to the Venezuelan Ambassador in Sweden, Horacio Arteaga. As soon as he heard about the event he decided to participate. He travelled over the day from Stockholm to Gothenburg (478 kilometres) to talk about the proposed constitutional reform and to express his gratitude to the work that the Hands Off Venezuela campaign has done. Ylva Vinberg, branch secretary of Young Left Angered opened the meeting and spoke about how the revolution in Venezuela has meant the return of socialism. It is important for us in Sweden were socialism and revolution have been off the agenda in the labour movement for a long time. After that Jorge Martin, the international secretary of the HOV campaign, made a speech to explain what is happening in Venezuela today. He said that is important to have a solidarity campaign to counter the lies from the mainstream media. For example now you can read that opposition students have been attacked by armed chavistas. The reality is that opposition students have attacked students that support the revolution. This shows the ""democratic"" character of the opposition, whose leaders all supported the coup in 2002. A crushing of the revolution would be a bloody affair similar to what happened in Chile 1973. oligarchy who uses them to sabotage the revolution. The people have started to organise in a revolutionary way in community councils (consejos comunales), workers council in the factories and in the new party PSUV (Venezuela's United Socialist Party) with more than 5 million having registered to join. The solution is to put the state and the economy under the democratic control of the people and to bring the revolution to its goal - a socialist Venezuela. The meeting continued with discussions and questions. After a lunch break there were three commissions - the role of women in the revolution, the new constitution and the new party PSUV. After the discussion there was a short report from each commission. Martin Lööf spoke about how the new party is born out of struggle and that there is a need for an organisation the can be a tool for the revolution. Erik Andersson spoke about the constitution, earlier there has been a contradiction between the development of the revolution and the old constitution but now with the new proposal the is an attempt to solve this contradiction. Catherine Holt spoke about how women play an important role in the revolution. One of the reasons why women in Venezuela are enthusiastic about the revolutions is because of the gains that have been made, that you cannot find in any other Latin American country except Cuba. But there are still many problems, at a grassroots level women are a majority but you need an active struggle on behalf of the women so that this will be reflected in the leadership of the movement. After this Egil Karlow spoke about the future for the HOV campaign and the political significance of our work. The struggle in Venezuela is an inspiration to us in Sweden, if its possible to have a 36-hour working week in relatively poor country as Venezuela why should it not be possible to have 30 hours in Sweden. After the discussion there was a vote for the proposals. Some of the resolutions that were passed were - The meeting ended with an enthusiastic singing of the international. In the evening there was a fundraising party for FRETECO. The troubadour Johan Andersson warmed up the audience before the main act, the socialist dance band Lazze Ohlys who played there own songs as well as radical classics as Bella Ciao and Warsawjanka. We want to give special gratitude to the band that not only played but also donated several of their records to the HOV-campaign. The great enthusiasm of the meeting can be seen in the financial results. After all expenses had been paid for we had collected over 2000 Swedish crowns (215 Euros) and sold HOV-material for over 1000 (107 Euros), which can be used to produce more material. Hands off Venezuela wants to express you gratitude to all delegates and all those who made the meeting possible. ",NA,NA

													Rodrigo Trompiz and Hands Off Venezuela"," Rob Sewell, member of the national Steering Committee, opened the conference, highlighting how the campaign has made significant progress in Britain and how even more support has been established amongst the students and the trade unions. Rob said that it was clear that the Bolivarian Revolution has great relevance for British workers too as it can serve as a great inspiration and lead to the awareness that changing society is possible. He also mentioned how, the previous week, Tory mayoral candidate Boris Johnson pressed Kim Howells, the Foreign Office minister who is responsible for Latin America, about corruption in Venezuela. Shamefully, Dr Howells replied that ""Venezuela was ranked 162 of a total of 179 in the Transparency International corruption perception index for 2007, down from 138th place in 2006."" Transparency International were also quoted in the disgraceful BBC This World documentary ""The Trillion Dollar Revolutionary,"" presented by journalist John Sweeney, to smear Venezuela as the second-most corrupt country in Latin America. However, as Ambassador Samuel Moncada later pointed out, this group has no credibility when it comes to Venezuela. Conference also passed an amended resolution condemning the ""biased and misleading"" BBC programme. First to speak was Derek Wall, national spokesperson for the Green Party. As a committed environmentalist, Derek said he was very impressed with the Bolivarian revolution's green credentials. In fact, he said, he was proud that his only transatlantic flight to date was to the World Social Forum in Venezuela last year! He also pointed out that ""Chavez is being attacked not for what he's doing wrong, but what he's doing right"" and declared that ""we need to inject a bit of Chavismo into British politics."" Next to speak was Venezuela's new ambassador to the UK Samuel Moncada, who gave a very stirring speech in defence of the Bolivarian process and thanked HOV for our continued support. He particularly stressed the dubious nature of Transparency International, which has ranked Venezuela the 2 nd most corrupt country in the Americas. The board of Transparency International Venezuela, Mr Moncada pointed out, contains coup-plotters who were signatories to the notorious Carmona decree in April 2002. Also speaking in the morning session was FBU General Secretary Matt Wrack who had the crowd cheering when he pointed out the hypocrisy of the British government accusing Venezuela of corruption. ""I think that we need to look a bit closer to home,"" he said, recounting the details of the recent privatisation of Ministry of Defence research division QinetiQ, which saw senior managers pocketing 20,000 per cent profits. John McDonnell MP spoke about the needs for cooperation and coordination between the different solidarity campaigns. He said the situation where HOV organises a meeting at a conference and then other campaigns organise meetings on the same day at the exact same time cannot continue. This was the reason behind his joint letter (with NUJ General Secretary Jeremy Dear) to the leaders of the trade unions who have backed HOV calling for them to organise a meeting to ensure these kinds of clashes become a thing of the past. He also demanded that the Brown government ""makes a choice between democracy or oligarchy,"" slamming new Labour's diplomatic policy of hostility toward the Venezuelan government. He pledged to make solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution an issue that ""no MP would be allowed to dodge."" Alan Woods spoke about Socialism of the 21 st century, and how this demonstrated that ""the end of history"" and the seemingly lack of opposition to the capitalism of the West was incorrect, and being proved so in Venezuela. Alan made the point that ‘Socialism of the 21 st century' was not a clearly defined term and because of this there was the danger of confusion in the revolution. There is the case of Baduel, a General who opposed the 2002 coup, but had now joined the opposition, and academics such as Heinz Dieterich who are wrapping capitalist ideas in a socialist rhetoric. Alan said that to build socialism you have to nationalise the principal sectors of the economy, as ""you cannot plan for what you do not control, and you cannot control what you do not own"". Caracas community activist Guadalupe Rodrigez thanked conference delegates for their support and stressed that it is ""important that we don't feel like we're on our own"" in Venezuela, before describing how her community was occupying a police station that had been notorious for torture and murder. She also stressed the leading role played by women in the Bolivarian revolution. In the afternoon session, five resolutions were passed on topics ranging from cooperation in the solidarity movement, the HOV magazine to the environment. A lively debate ensued and amendments were added to several of the resolutions. These resolutions can be seen at the end of this article. The afternoon session featured workshops on Socialism of the 21 st century, the media in Venezuela, workers' control and constitutional reform. All the workshops featured some very lively debate and participants were left feeling enthused and energised about the whole revolutionary process. The final plenary session featured contributions from CWU Deputy General Secretary Tony Kearns and Nelson Rodriguez. Tony Kearns made the point that in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America solidarity campaigns had only been active once the movement there had been defeated by imperialism. Venezuela is one of the few places in the world where there is something positive happening, so it is crucial to build solidarity with it now. Nelson gave a very inspiring speech about Inveval and the experience of workers' control there. He explained how the top decision making body was the general assembly of workers, and workers elected to deal with particular aspects of management, finance, technical, services etc. were accountable to this body and could be recalled at any time. Those elected continue to receive the same wages as all the other workers. Delegates from Inveval also participate in the local communal councils as well as battalions of the PSUV. The conference was closed by NUJ General Secretary Jeremy Dear, who although unwell, said that the only thing that would inspire him to get up and out was the Bolivarian Revolution! Jeremy announced the launch of a new ""mediawatch"" group that would span the English-speaking world and declared his determination to ""mobilise the international labour movement in support of the Bolivarian revolution."" The whole day was a great success and left everyone inspired to carry on the struggle to defend the Venezuelan people and their Bolivarian revolution. RESOLUTIONS FOR HANDS OFF VENEZUELA NATIONAL CONFERENCE NOVEMBER 24th 2007 Conference supports the broadest possible solidarity work in defence of Venezuela's Bolivarian revolution; and, in furtherance of this aim, supports the initiative of John McDonnell and Jeremy Dear to convene a meeting between the solidarity groups and trade union affiliates to explore how solidarity work can be co-ordinated more effectively. proposed by the National Steering Committee Conference recognises the successful record of Hands Off Venezuela in bringing the news of the Bolivarian revolution to the trade union movement, having intervened in all the main trade unions over the last four years and, as a result, helped to get motions on Venezuela passed at the TUC; recognises, given the crucial stage that the Bolivarian revolution is currently at, the need to step up solidarity work in the trade unions; and, in order to plan an effective intervention in next year's conferences, supports the organisation of a trade union seminar in the House of Commons in early 2008 to which all trade union supporters will be invited. proposed by the National Steering Committee Conference notes that, on December 2nd, Venezuelans will vote in a referendum on the reform of the Bolivarian constitution; also notes that the stated aim of the 69 amendments is to ""build Venezuelan socialism as the only road towards the redemption of our people, the salvation of our country and the building of a new world""; further notes that, as a response to this process of reform, there has been a renewed campaign against the Bolivarian revolution on the part of the oligarchy and imperialism, including economic sabotage, violence in the streets and university campuses and a campaign in the national and international media of lies and distortions regarding the actual content of the proposed constitutional reform; and reaffirms its support for the Bolivarian revolution, which has been democratically ratified by the overwhelming majority of Venezuelans on numerous occasions, and urges all members of Hands Off Venezuela to commit themselves to stepping up the solidarity work, to respond to the media lies and to lobby their MPs to sign Early Day Motion 286, which was tabled by campaign joint-president John McDonnell and which deals specifically with these issues. proposed by Jorge Martin Conference welcomes the publication of the latest Hands Off Venezuela magazine; regards the magazine as a vital tool for reaching potential supporters who either don't have access to the internet or who haven't yet heard about the revolutionary process in Venezuela; believes that members of Hands Off Venezuela should each be mailed a copy of the magazine for free; and resolves to increase the number of magazines published each year. proposed by Charley Allan Conference notes that the previous model of economic development in Venezuela has resulted in severe ecological degradation in many parts of the country; also notes that it is the country's working class and poor who have been most adversely affected by this disregard for environmental considerations which the race for profits has created; further notes: (1) the plan by the Environment and Natural Resource Ministry to reduce the air pollution levels in Caracas by 80 percent in 2007, with the goal of being pollution free by 2010, (2) the improved protection of waterways and fishing areas, especially those affected by oil exploration and drilling, (3) the protection of unique ecological areas and indigenous lands, such as the 3.6 million-hectare Imataca Forest Reserve, (4) the assistance given to thousands of coffee-growing families in the Andes region to establish environmentally sustainable organic coffee and vegetable co-operatives, (5) the banning of the cultivation of genetically engineered crops on Venezuelan soil and the establishment of a large seed bank to maintain indigenous seeds for peasant movements around the world; agrees to show our full support for such important developments by trying to disseminate information about the revolution's commitment to Venezuela's environment in our publications; expresses its concern that a few large mining and energy projects - such as the opening of further coal concessions in the Sierra Perija and the plan for a gas pipeline through the Amazon basin to Argentina - appear to repeat the old pattern of disregard for the environment and have brought opposition from indigenous groups and environmentalists in Venezuela and other countries of Latin America; therefore urges the Bolivarian government to submit all such development plans to the strictest environmental and socio-ecological standards and to direct democratic control by the communities concerned. proposed by Liam McQuade ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela Denmark"," Last week, Rubén Linares, national coordinator of the revolutionary Venezuelan trade union confederation, the UNT, came to Denmark on a speaking tour organised by the Danish Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The aim was on the one hand to cut across the falsifications that the established media spreads about Chávez and the Venezuelan government, and on the other hand to hear about the developments of the impressive revolutionary events unfolding in the country. Over seven days, Rubén spoke at 9 different public meetings, which attracted a total of nearly 400 people all across the country. A part from that, he visited schools across the country, met Danish trade-unionists and was able to participate in the massive demonstrations against the government on the 2nd of October. The Danish Social Forum took place on the weekend of 28-29 September. This year's event was significantly smaller than previous years. Despite this, Hands Off Venezuela managed to organize two important and well-attended meetings with Rubén Linares, who was one of the main guests at the forum. The first one took place on Friday afternoon where some 35 people gathered in the small Latin America-bar to hear Rubén speak on the developments of the Venezuelan revolution. Here he gave a full explanation of the background to the present situation in the country, the Caracazo uprising of 1989 and the brutal repression following it, the 1992-insurrection of Chávez, his electoral victory in 1998, etc. The next day Rubén spoke on Latin America in a joint debate together with the Cuban economist José Perez. This meeting was organized jointly by HOV together with other solidarity groups such as Dansk-Cubansk Forening and Internationalt Forum. More than 120 people showed up for this meeting. At this meeting, Rubén focused his speech on the continental process developing throughout Latin America. He emphasised that one of the key aspects has been the struggle against privatisation, as in the case of Bolivia, for example in Cochabamba. In connection to this, he stressed that he believed that: ""Every trade unionist who acts in favour of privatisation, is in fact betraying the working class"". He received a powerful ovation for this remark. Rubén also spoke about the cynical exploitation committed by imperialism in Latin America. When imperialism nowadays attacks Chávez for giving out oil to his friends as ""presents"", it forgets that multinational companies for decades have had free access to the full exploitation of the natural resources of the country. ""Weren't we giving presents out at that time too?"" Rubén asked. ""Now we are simply using the oil resources in a rational manner, as a means of integration, as a means of giving the poor an opportunity"". On two occasions Rubén was able to visit Danish trade unions and exchange experience on workers' struggles and the unionisation of workers. The first place was 3F (the union of the unskilled workers in Denmark) in the city of Silkeborg. Here he met with Christian Juhl, the president of the union and a supporter of the left-wing trade union network Fagligt Ansvar. For Rubén it was a big inspiration to see how the local 3F union was organised and how it plays an important role in securing the right of the workers in terms of security, wage-payments and organisation. It was especially impressive for him to see the regional school that educates lorry-drivers and transport workers. Rubén remarked that this is one of the main problems in Venezuela; while many bosses impose a 90-hour work week on the lorry-drivers who transport combustibles from one end of the country to another, safety is also an urgent problem facing the workers. Many lorry-drivers do not receive the appropriate education and the risk of accidents is thereby tripled. The capitalists in the transport sector have done absolutely nothing to solve this, on the contrary, they impel youngsters to work as lorry drivers without the necessary education. Rubén also was also able to go to the headquarters of the Metal workers' union in Copenhagen. Here he interviewed the leaders of its youth section and was able to exchange experiences on the differences and similarities Rubén was also invited to speak at meetings with school students. The first of these took place in the secondary school of Silkeborg, where nearly 30 students gathered on their break to hear a short introduction to the Venezuelan revolution and ask Rubén about the role of the youth in the Bolivarian revolution. The other occasion was in Det Fri Gymnasium on Thursday, October 4th. This is one of the secondary schools in Copenhagen where the students have tended most towards left-wing ideas. Rubén had the possibility to speak for some 40 minutes to their weekly students' assembly with over 130 students present. His speech was greeted with big applause and a number of people asked interesting questions afterwards, about the role of Chávez, the oil in Venezuela, etc. Both teachers and students at this school thanked Rubén warmly for his presence. Apart from visits to the Social Forum, schools and trade unions, Hands Off Venezuela also organised open public meetings. The first one took place in Aarhus (the second largest city of the country) with some 35 people attending. Although there were a number of supporters of the Venezuelan opposition present at this meeting who made a big deal out of finding any small incident, slander and every excuse possible to discredit the Venezuelan government, Rubén gave an excellent account of the real state of affairs in Venezuela. Unmasking the false intentions of the opposition he showed with facts, figures and arguments how Venezuela's revolutionary process has conquered free health care for the 60% of the population that didn't have access to it before 2003, which has also brought more than 2 million people out of illiteracy. In Copenhagen two other public meetings where organised. The first one on Wednesday 3 October, was organised by Hands Off Venezuela together with the Café of World-Culture. 35 people turned up to an evening full of discussions and in-depth information about questions such as the PSUV, the history of Venezuela, the agrarian reform, economic sabotage of the bosses, the struggle of the gas workers for nationalisation, etc. Also, on the last evening of the speaking tour, Thursday 4 of October, the only left wing-daily that remains in Denmark, ""Dagbladet Arbejderen"" (Daily worker) and its publisher, Kommunistisk Parti, organized a meeting in their premises. With some 30 people present, the theme for this meeting was the question of PSUV and its consequences for the labour movement. In this event, Rubén explained how 5.5 million Venezuelans have signed up to join the new party. In the assemblies of the battalions, more than 1.3 million have showed up and the elections of 14,000 representatives (one for each battalion) have now taken place. All this bodes well for the development of the party in a democratic fashion, built from below. On Tuesday, 2 October, the Danish trade union movement called for a day of action against the right-wing government. Rubén participated in the big demonstration in Copenhagen where 90,000 gathered in the 2nd biggest demonstration since 1985. Rubén was impressed to see that the workers and youth of Denmark are willing to defend the welfare rights that they conquered in the past. He especially emphasised the demand of the protestors against cuts to kindergartens showed that this was a struggle for the future. All in all, this speaking tour was a great success. Apart from the good turnout at all the meetings, the school assemblies, trade union visits, etc. the activities have served to spread knowledge about the Venezuelan revolution and put the Hands Off Venezuela campaign on the political map in Denmark. In all his speeches, Rubén put forward a clear revolutionary position, not only defending the Venezuelan revolution and its conquest, but also giving a clear class point of view; explaining the marvellous struggles of the Venezuelan working class at all levels of society. He ended most of his speeches with a sentence of Che Guevara, which illustrates very well the desire for a final victory of the exploited masses of Venezuela and Latin America: ""Que lo sepan los nacidos y los que estan por nacer. Que los revolucionarios del mundo nacimos para vencer y no para ser vencidos"" (""All those who have been born, and those who will be born know this - that the revolutionaries of the world, we are born to win, not to be defeated"").

			The five “engines” for Socialism: meetings in support of the Venezuelan Revolution in Ireland",2007-10-15T00:00:00Z,"
															
													P. Bowman (Dublin)"," Hands off Venezuela, in co-operation with the Venezuela Support Group and the James Connolly Debating society in Belfast, organised two meetings in support of the Venezuelan Revolution in Dublin (8 October) and Belfast (10 October). The idea was also to continue with the campaign Hands off Venezuela - Ireland, already constituted after a first round of meetings held last April at two Irish Universities. More than 35 people attended the meeting in Dublin (including activists from SIPTU and other unions, from the Connolly Youth Movement, éirígí, the Labour Youth, the CPI and others). The meeting in Belfast was hosted by the James Connolly Debating Society and had an enthusiastic audience of about 60 people from many different backgrounds. The meetings intended to explain ""the five engines for socialism""; the programme that the Venezuelan government will try to implement in the near future. 63 per cent of the population of Venezuela voted for that programme in the election held last December. Carlos Fiorillo, member of the Unified Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and Hands off Venezuela - Ireland, presented for the first time in English some sections of three speeches about the ""5 engines"" that President Hugo Chavez made between the 8 th and the 17 th of January 2007. Carlos said: The first engine, Carlos went on, is the enabling law. With that law the Venezuelan government will be able to nationalise all that was privatised; the second engine is a constitutional change to allow the people of Venezuela to go towards socialism. President Hugo Chavez, according to Carlos, said that, ""Venezuelans [in the election last December] voted for socialism ... [Socialism] is what people want ... [Socialism] is what the country needs... Venezuela is free, we are not colony of anybody."" The third engine is national education on socialist values and solidarity, and access to education for all at all levels: ""study is the debate of ideas in a permanent way."" The fourth engine is a new ""geometry"" of power, based on popular power, in order to eliminate the differences between classes and the obscene privileges of the bureaucrats and the ruling class. The fifth engine, Carlos concluded, was the ""explosion"" of popular, revolutionary, socialist and democratic power through the creation of communal councils and federations of communal councils. Jorge Martin, international secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, analysed the current situation in Venezuela. The political process unfolding in Venezuela, he said, has a socialist character and is fully democratic. It is not the first time that Hugo Chavez has won an election, but this time he got 63 per cent of the votes, he said. The problem, Jorge argued, is that the imperialist powers don't agree with the nationalisation of the basic means of production in order to satisfied the needs of the people of Venezuela; it goes against their profits. This is so even when any nationalisation and expropriation that has taken place, has been carried out according to law and with payment of compensation. So, Jorge continued, the imperialists will try anything they can to get rid of Chavez and put back into power the old corrupt oligarchy. They already tried with the US-backed military coup and the bosses lock-out in 2002. This shows the hypocrisy of the US and European governments when they accuse Chavez of being undemocratic. In the meeting in Belfast some people in the audience asked what people could do in Ireland to support the people of Venezuela and to stop the imperialist intervention. In Dublin, some also expressed the need to actively support the Bolivarian movement. Jorge Martin made clear, first, that the broadest possible movement in solidarity with Venezuela should be organised in Ireland. He made an appeal to all those who agree with three basic principles - full support for the Bolivarian revolution, against imperialist intervention and counteracting the lies of the media - should join Hands Off Venezuela. The first thing to do, he said, was to tell the youth and the workers in our communities what is really happening in Venezuela. That is the only way to counteract the lies spread in the mass media, owned by a few large corporations, about the Venezuelan government. This could be done by organising talks and showing documentaries in colleges and in meetings with trade unionists, by passing resolutions in trade union congresses, by getting youth organisations and trade unions to link up with our solidarity groups, etc. He underlined several times the importance of getting the support of the working class in our communities through their trade unions. Jorge Martin suggested raising funds and getting trade unions to sponsor delegation trips of Irish workers and students to Venezuela in order to witness what is really happening there, and reporting back in their communities, trade unions, and study places. We would like to thank all those who made these meeting possible. Contact Hands Off Venezuela Ireland ( This email address is being protected from spambots.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," On Wednesday 27 September 2007, around 35 people attended the London branch of Hands off Venezuela's special meeting on workers control and different forms of social property in Venezuela. There then followed a lively debate on the topic, particularly on the question of whether 100% nationalisation of factories, which has been called for at Sanitarios Maracay, was to be preferred over ""co-management"", where the workers own 49% and the state 51%. This latter form of ownership has been introduced at other nationalised plants. Some argued that more important than the form of ownership of individual factories was that the key levers of the economy be in the hands of the state rather than the private sector. A very successful meeting, look out for the London group's next monthly special! ",NA,NA

			The struggle for nationalisation continues",2007-08-08T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Leonardo Badel and Yonie Moreno"," After 8 months of occupation, the struggle of the workers at Sanitarios Maracay is more alive than ever before, despite the problems they are facing. On July 18 th , a delegation from Hands off Venezuela and the Revolutionary Marxist Current went to Maracay to hand over the 1,318,000 Bolivars collected in the last weeks by Hands off Venezuela, Britain. The delegation was received by Luis Alvarado, a leading member of the union at Sanitarios Maracay, who explained the difficulties the workers are going through due to the delay by the Bolivarian government in deciding over the nationalisation of the factory, which is translated into problems with securing raw materials and supplies (many of them imported) and makes it very difficult to keep production and, therefore, to find the money for the workers' wages. This situation has meant a reduction in the levels of production of around 5%, which in turn has worsened the workers' material conditions. Some months ago, they took to their homes 100,000 Bolivars and a box of food. Now, however, they only get 20,000 Bolivars and the box of food, which has forced many of them to apply for a temporary leave to find a temporary job to feed their families. In spite of this situation the morale is high. They know well that this struggle goes beyond wages and that it is a struggle for their dignity and for the construction of socialism in Venezuela. They are confident that ChÃ¡vez will end up nationalising the factory. They keep on the struggle because of political conviction and revolutionary faith; with the same conviction that led them to occupy the factory, constitute the factory committee, impose workers' control within the factory and demand their nationalisation under workers' control. {google}-3480375567950358328{/google} This experience has had its enemies within and outside the revolutionary process. On one side there are the capitalists headed by Alvaro Pocaterra, who is doing everything possible to smash the workers, and on the other side there is the reformist bureaucracy, the bourgeois state apparatus, which see as a threat the extension and consolidation of the workers' control over production and is not interested in a repetition of an experience like this at Sanitarios Maracay. The promises of the National Assembly MPs in relation to move on with the nationalisation of the factory have not come true yet. In spite of all this, the workers at Sanitarios Maracay keep up the fight and continue producing bathroom suites under workers' control. All the contradictions taking place in the struggle at Sanitarios Marcay can only be resolved by spreading the occupation of factories on a national level and this can only be carried out by the organised working class and especially the UNT. FRETECO has defended that the UNT should call for a National Day of Factory Occupations, linking this up with the struggle of the comrades from the Ezequiel Zamora Peasants Front who must carry out a campaign for the occupation of lands and its nationalisation under the toilers' control. If Sanitarios Maracay is expropriated it cannot survive in a sea of capitalism since, as in Inveval, they will have problems with raw material and bureaucratism. For that reason this struggle must spread on a national level. The financial help of 1,318,000 Bolivars given by the comrades of Hands Off Venezuela to support the struggle of the workers at Sanitarios Maracay and encourage them in their fight, raised the morale of the workers and showed them that they are not alone, but that the working class of all over the world is closely watching what is going on in this factory of bathroom suites already 8 months into their struggle for nationalisation. At present, it is important that the support for the comrades at Sanitarios Maracay continues wherever we are (workplaces, lands, study centres, etc.) and to follow the example of the comrades from Hands off Venezuela, intensifying the struggle for socialism there where we are. Today there are plenty of debates about how socialism of the 21 st Century should be. The workers at Sanitarios Maracay do not lose their time discussing on how or what socialism must be - they practice it at every moment. For Nationalisation under Workers' Control! For Spreading the Factories' Occupation on a National Level! For Building Socialism! Fatherland, Socialism or Death! ",NA,NA

			Venezuela fringe meeting at Trades Union Congress",2007-09-17T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Patrick MacDonald"," The Hands Off Venezuela fringe meeting at this year's TUC in Brighton was very successful, despite the great competition from other fringe meetings at the same time. Rob Sewell led off with an impassioned speech on the revolutionary developments in Venezuela that left nobody in any doubt of the progress that has been accomplished over the past decade. Rob spoke about the contrasting fortunes of Blair and Chavez since their respective elections in 1997 and 1998 and how the popularity of one nose-dived while the other rocketed. The last election saw Chavez claim 7.3 million votes (63%), which was due to the dramatic and positive achievements of the revolution. Rob gave some anecdotes of young people racing around Caracas on Election Day, thrilled to be part of the occasion. ""People were being woken up at 2:00 in the morning to participate on election day; people were queuing and voting and young people were holding 10 fingers, to represent the 10 million votes they were willing Chavez to win."" ""It was the most enthusiastic election campaign which reflected the revolutionary situation in Venezuela today"", he said. Rob pointed out that it has only been after his rise to power, that Chavez awoke to the only ""real"" alternative of socialism. ""It was only through concrete, material events that Chavez realised that socialism was the way forward."" This led Chavez to declare that the last election was not a ""vote for Chavez, but a vote for Socialism"". Alan McLean, the vice president of the FBU, who spoke next, stated that events like those happening in Venezuela were ones that he had been ""striving for [his] whole life"". Alan acknowledged that the only way to protect the gains of the Venezuelan revolution was to help spread solidarity. Why should it not be possible to have the same things going on in this country that are taking place over there?"" said Alan. ""We should be sending delegations so that people can really see what is going on in Venezuela"". Alan finished by saying that it was a duty to keep Venezuela ""in the public eye"" for as long as it takes, to achieve socialist the goal that it set itself. John McDonnell congratulated those ""far-sighted"" enough to have identified what was taking place in Venezuela and the potential for this democratic revolution to turn into a socialist revolution. At this moment, the revolution is empowering millions of Venezuelans of all ages. John was adamant that in order to correctly analyse the events in Venezuela, it was necessary mot be to frightened by terminology such as ""Revolution"" and ""Socialism"". The whole movement in Britain needed to embrace the changes in Latin America. On the same note, John felt it was high time that a dialogue was started between the different Venezuela solidarity organisations, and that in the future joint fringe meetings should be held at the various union conferences around the country. He joked that Jeremy Dear would be ""more than happy"" to stand down from the national body, if it meant unifying the work of the other campaigns. John also said that he would do all he could to force acknowledgment of the Venezuelan Revolution by the British government. ""We must do our best to inform central government of the great changes that are happening in Venezuela and to dispel the myths from the press about Chavez."" In the lively question session that followed, people asked how to counter the day-to-day arguments of those that called Venezuela a dictatorship. The panel answered that Chavez' election results, where he has won every election he has ever taken part in (they amount to a dozen), speaks for itself. They also added that the right to constant participation in elections is not the mark of a dictatorship, for prime ministers in this country enjoy this freedom too, though none could ever boast such popularity as Chavez.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," Around 70 people packed London's Salmon and Compass screening room last Thursday to watch the newly made documentary No Volveran - The Venezuelan Revolution Now. Hosted by the Movimientos - Latin America Network , the ground-breaking documentary took viewers on a colourful journey, deep into the Venezuelan revolution, through the ferver of the presidential elections, and out to the factories run under workers' control, to find out what socialism of the 21st century is, and how it is changing peoples lives. The film sparked vibrant discussion, with the one of the film makers, William Roche, present to answer questions. William updated the audience on the situation at Sanitarios Maracay, the main factory featured in the film, where the workers have seen their application for nationalisation refused by the Ministry of Labour, which has led to extreme difficulties for the factory workers. William also took questions about the newly proposed Venezuelan constitution, land reform, and Chavez's policies on the environment. One member of the audience asked about the possibility of future US acts of sabotage against the revolution. William explained that, after the failure of the imperialist coup of 2002, and whilst the revolution remains so popular, the biggest danger to the revolution lays in the bureaucracy within the country itself. These bureaucrats, old and new, are opposed to the socialist project, and are sabotaging and subverting the process from within. The film maker went on to explain how he felt that the future success of the socialist project lays in the building of the new United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). If a united party of the masses, built from below can be established with a shared ideological goal, then future campaigns from worker controlled factories, like that of Sanitarios Maracay, would be successful, and socialism of the 21st century could become a reality for the Venezuelan people.

													Hands Off Venezuela Canada"," On Thursday, September 20th Hands Off Venezuela Toronto held the North American premiere of ""No Volveran."" Over 100 people packed into the theatre, including a special guest, Oscar Perez Cristancho a Deputy of National Assembly of Venezuela. The crowd greeted the movie with a lot of enthusiasm, with many good questions about the nature and future of the revolution being asked by the audience at the Q&A session after the screening. One young woman asked about the legal situation around the non-renewal of RCTV's broadcasting license. Director Melanie MacDonald answered this quite well, referring the RCTV's support of the 2002 coup against the Chavez government and raising a discussion about just how free the capitalist ""free"" press really is. Two anti-Chavistas in the group also asked a question, though they were less concerned with answer and more concerned with attempted to trip up HOV. Asking if the HOV delegation to Venezuela, depicted in the film, had received financing from any outside group (implying that HOV was being paid off by the Chavez government). MacDonald again replied very well to this, making very clear that the whole HOV delegation paid for their trip out of their own pockets and was fiscally beholden to no one. MacDonald was congratulated by practically everyone (except the two oppositionists) in the crowd. Many were extremely inspired by the film and by the revolution that it depicted. The big event allowed for some healthy fundraising to go towards future solidarity activities. Many of the attendees also bought copies of ""No Volveran"" on DVD, which helps to get the message out to an even wider audience. HOV Canada plans to use this great launch event to organize more showings of this revolutionary documentary across the country. HOV would like to thank the generous support of the Venezuelan Consulate in Toronto, which helped make this impressive event possible.

			The case of RCTV explained in Brussels",2007-06-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Pas Touche au Venezuela Brussels"," On Tuesday 12 June some 70 people gathered in the Centro Cultural Garcia Lorca as part of the ""Mardis Politiques"", an evening of political debate hosted by Izquierda Unida Brussels Branch (the left party in Spain) to watch the premiere of a film by Angel Palacios (""La seÃ±al es nuestra""). The event had been organised by Pas Touche au Venezuela / Hands Off Venezuela in Brussels to counteract the rivers of ink that have been written to attack the Venezuelan revolution about the non-renewal of RCTV licence. The meeting was supported by diffent organisations who last year organised a national event with more than 350 people in Brussels (includes: Vonk, Oxfam SolidaritÃ©, Collectif Venezuela 13 Avril, Arlac, Vrede, Socialisme Sans FrontiÃ¨res, Daniel Gillard Committee). Present were also the Ambassador of Cuba and different leaders of the Walloon young peasant's federation, the FUJA, who are really enthusiastic about the ongoing process in Venezuela. The debate started with a brief introduction by Ronnie Ramirez, film-teacher in Brussels and former collaborator of Vive-TV. He explained the content of the documentary that had been produced in Venezuela to explain the role of RCTV during the coup of 2002 and other counterrevolutionary activities of the channel. He also introduced a new collective, called Vive-Belgique, which translates and subtitles programmes on mediosdelpueblo.org Then a very attentive audience watched the film for about an hour. Followed by a debate introduced by the coordinator of the Campaign Pas Touche au Venezuela/Hands Off Venezuela, Erik Demeester. The worldwide campaign on ""freedom of speech', he explained, against the decision not to renew the licence of RCTV, is part of a plan to destabilise the revolution. The demonstrations of rich students must be added to the economic sabotage, the artificial food shortages etc., aimed at undermining the revolution which has radicalised since the beginning of the year. The panel also had Alejandro Fleming, ambassador of Venezuela in Belgium and Paul-Emile Dupret, who works for the parliamentary group of the Unitary European Left (GUE-GVN) and was active in the bringing the resolution before the European Parliament, which was voted down by a coalition of far-right, Christian democrats and liberals. In the debate, the moderator made a call to continue the unitary effort that is being made in Belgium to work in a broad coalition to support the Bolivarian Revolution. Erik concluded with proposals for a real extension of freedom of speech. â€˜The radio-electrical spectrum should be completely public and under the democratic control of the workers, the communities. Real access to the different media should be guaranteed by their nationalisation"". Paul-Emile explained the situation, how the rightwing in the European Parliament manoeuvres and Alejandro made a detailed account of the real meaning of the so-called student demonstrations. Also part of the audience was Ivan Hernandez, Vice-Minister of the Popular power, Mining and Basic industries. He told us about his past in the socialist movement and how the ruling class is using the students against the revolution. After an in-depth debate where all points of view were heard, a collection raised over 70 euros for the campaign and there is the perspective of a workshop about revolutionary media in September. The campaign of the press and media of the ruling class was answered by this event in a modest but important way. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela"," The following two resolutions were passed yesterday at the Amicus national conference with only two votes against. A full report will appear tomorrow. We also reproduce the HoV leaflet that was distributed amongst the delegates. 173 VENEZUELA This Conference notes that the government of Hugo Chavez since its was first elected in 1998 has brought health care to the sick, education to the illiterate, housed the homeless and redistributed millions of acres of land. The constitution guarantees the public ownership of the oil industry and the distribution of wealth to all citizens. This conference congratulates the Hands off Venezuela Campaign for its role in drawing to the attention of the British Labour movement the continuing revolution being carried out by the Venezuelan people. The Venezuelan government's popularity has been proven time and time again culminating in the ringing endorsement of the referendum of 2004 in which the Chavez government gained 60% of the popular vote. The Venezuelan revolution is in danger and has been threatened on more than one occasion. A far right coup was attempted in 2002 only to be defeated by the people. This was followed by a bosses lockout. Again the workers came to the rescue and ran the factories without the bosses, ensuring the economy did not collapse. Shamefully the United States has opposed the Chavez government since its election and has supported every undemocratic attempt to overthrow it. The real motives of the Bush regime are exposed by the call from Pat Robertson to assassinate Chavez. International solidarity with the people of Venezuela is vital if the revolution is to survive. Amicus pledges, NORTH WEST 174. SUPPORT VENEZUELA'S BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION This Conference congratulates and supports the colossal advances being made by the Venezuelan Revolution under President Hugo Chavez in carrying out policies, which benefit working people, the poor and the landless. Conference recognises that the nine electoral victories won by Hugo Chavez since 1998, provide the Revolution with an overwhelming popular mandate. This reflects the overwhelming support for the social programmes carried out by the government in relation to education, literacy, healthcare, land reform and subsidised food. Conference views with alarm the bellicose threats from the US Administration and its imperialist puppets, including the Venezuelan oligarchy and the Colombian Government, which pose a real threat to the life of Chavez as well as the Revolution itself. Conference therefore opposes all outside interference in the affairs of Venezuela. Conference expresses its support for the National Union of Workers (UNT) as the legitimate voice of the organised working class and calls upon our union to build links with its Venezuelan counterpart. Furthermore, Conference calls upon the NEC to support a delegation to Venezuela in order to establish bonds of brotherhood between workers in Britain and Venezuela, as well as inviting trade unionists from Venezuela to Britain. Furthermore, Conference pledges its support for the initiatives of labour movement backed campaigns that further the above aims. GENERAL INDUSTRIES Affiliate to the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign! WHY SHOULD AMICUS AFFILIATE TO HOV? The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign is a broad-based solidarity campaign, set up to support the Venezuelan Revolution following the failed coup in April 2002. It is now active in 40 countries, including Venezuela. Since then, it has spread the message of the achievements taking place in Venezuela, especially in the British trade union field. As a result, Hugo Chavez has publicly praised the solidarity work of HOV on a number of occasions, including on his visit to London last year. As a result of our work, many trade unions voted to affiliate or support to HOV, such as the shop workers union USDAW, the Communication Workers' Union , Public and Commerical Services Union , the GMB, Fire Brigades Union , the train drivers union ASLEF, National Union of Journalists , college lecturers union , public sector workers union UNISON, BECTU, Community, TGWU and AMICUS. Surely it is better to be involved with both solidarity organizations, than to exclude one over the other? This will prevent duplication and assist the co-ordination of the solidarity work for Venezuela. It makes perfect sense. The work of our supporters in AMICUS has resulted in TWO resolutions supporting Venezuela at this conference. Together, HOV, AMICUS and VIC, can jointly promote the Venezuelan Revolution. Rodrigo Chaves, the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela, who will be present at AMICUS conference, has also urged all the solidarity organizations to work together when he met with us last September in London. Again, passing resolution 173 will facilitate this cooperation. If Hands Off Venezuela is good enough for Hugo Chavez, then surely it is good enough for AMICUS! WE URGE AMICUS DELEGATES TO AFFILIATE TO BOTH CAMPAIGNS. PLEASE SUPPORT RESOLUTION No. 173! Join Hands Off Venezuela today! ",NA,NA

													Ben Peck and Pat MacDonald"," Monday was a red letter day for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Amicus/Unity, the second biggest union in Britain, voted practically unanimously to affiliate to the HOV campaign. This represents a great step forward for the campaign in the trade union field. The resolution (173) was moved by Sherell Martin, from the North West region of the union. Sherell spoke about the great achievements of the Venezuelan revolution and praised the work of Hands Off Venezuela, especially its solidarity with the workers of Sanitarios Maracay. Sherell concluded her speech by calling on delegates to support both resolutions (173 and 174) welcoming the Venezuelan Revolution and urging the union to affiliate to HOV. Espe Espigares seconded the motion and also moved resolution 174. Espe also urged support for both resolutions and explained that the Venezuelan Revolution is moving forward by the Venezuelan people taking their destinies into their own hands. They have started the task of reconstructing society along socialist lines. She also explained that the Venezuelan people have stood up to the USA, telling them ""we won't be your back yard any longer, you won't bleed our natural resources any more"". Espe explained that since our 2005 conference, when 97% of delegates voted in favour of supporting Hands Off Venezuela, several branches of Amicus have invited campaign speakers and have affiliated to HOV, including the North West region, the biggest region of the union. Conference warmly applauded this solidarity work. For reasons best known to the NEC, they recommended opposition to resolution 173. This was linked to the idea that the union was now affiliated to the Venezuelan Information Centre and therefore affiliation to HOV would ""confuse"" things. This argument did not hold water as other unions were affiliated to both unions and this did not interfere with their solidarity work. Following this, Sherell was asked to reply. She explained briefly that there was no contradiction in supporting both motions, 173 and 174, and thanked conference for its warm support. The vote was then taken on both resolutions, which were passed almost unanimously, with only two votes against. The decision to affiliate to HOV is a massive step forward for the campaign. After last week's vote at the GMB Conference to affiliate to the campaign, together with support from Unison and the T&G, means that the Hands Off Venezuela campaign now has the support from the four largest trade unions in Britain, comprising some four million workers.

													Niklas Svensson"," The first showing of the new film No Volveran attracted a large number of people. On Wednesday, 20 July, 120 people gathered at the Bolivar Hall in London to watch the new documentary by Will Roche and Melanie MacDonald (see further details here). The first screening of the new documentary was a great success and another step forward for the solidarity movement. The film comes at crucial point in the Venezuelan Revolution. The setting up of a new United Socialist Party, the decision to nationalise the electricity and telecommunications industry and the non-renewal of the license of RCTV all set the scene for what Chavez calls the ""socialist phase"" of the revolution. This new phase has been met with a renewed offensive from mainstream media against the government of Venezuela. Although recorded in December, the documentary deals with most of the lies told in the last six months. The focus of the documentary is not on the many improvements in the living conditions of the millions of poor Venezuelans but on how to move forward, on how to consolidate these gains and make sure the oligarchy doesn't make a come-back. It gives its audience an insight into the dangers and opportunities that face the Venezuelan people in this new phase of their revolution. The audience at the screening was also very positive towards the film. Afterwards the film makers received many positive comments. Two students from Venezuela expressed their gratitude at the fact that people outside Venezuela were participating in the process. A visitor from Russia wondered if there was going to be a Russian translation. One person asked about the dangers of a military counter-revolution. A member of the London Hands Off Venezuela campaign made an appeal for money for the workers of Sanitarios Maracay who were interviewed in the film, and over Â£200 was collected. Several people promised to turn up to the next Hands Off Venezuela meeting in London to continue building the solidarity movement. The screening was a promising beginning for the first documentary produced by Hands Off Venezuela activists. It is a step forward for the solidarity campaign and the film will now be distributed all over the world and a Spanish version is already under way. Purchase the DVD at the Hands Off Venezuela shop .

													Ben Peck"," Following the non-renewal of the TV station RCTV this month, Hands off Venezuela met at the NUJ headquarters in London to discuss what the real situation is. The mainstream media has generally reported this as a closure of the TV station, rather than a decision by the government not to grant a new concession on the public airwaves, and has been used as a point of focus for those forces that oppose Venezuelaâ€™s move toward socialism. Student demonstrations and violence have broken out in Caracas, protesting against the non-renewal. The TV station has been running for 53 years, longer than any other in Venezuela. In December 2006 Chavez made public his intention not to renew the RCTV concession due to the stationâ€™s persistence in trying to overthrow the elected government, including participation in the April 2002 coup and the bossesâ€™ lock-out later that year. Over 50 people, filling the meeting room where many had to stand, attended the meeting. Jorge Martin, International Secretary for HoV, began by explaining some of the facts and figures around this issue (please see Venezuela and freedom of speech â€“ 4 lies, 4 answers ) Â Next Charley Allan, Member of the Hands off Venezuela steering committee, addressed the meeting having just arrived back in England from Bolivia where he had been invited to a gathering of intellectuals and artists supporting the Venezuelan revolution. Charley gave a report of his time spent there, and his visit to Caracas, where he described the discontent expressed by many ordinary Venezuelans on account of having been deprived of their daily soap-opera intake, provided by RCTV. A lively discussion followed, unfortunately not for long enough due to the room booking, where students from Venezuela described their worries and frustrations at what is happening in their country and the inability of the private media to express itself and its interests, now that RCTV had only satellite frequencies through which to operate. The debate got heated at times, which is only natural when talking about matters so concrete and controversial. The meeting finished with a screening of a government-produced film called Diga la verdad (Tell the Truth), which attempted to justify the ending of RCTVâ€™s concession based on the supposed lack of morality that went into the TV stationâ€™s scheduling, as well as its role in the 2002 coup and other anti-government activities. Unfortunately, this short film did little to represent the political factors involved. The meeting was very successful in its attempt to counter the anti-Chavez media campaign being spun around this recent event, which is cynically looking for a point of reference by which to mount another challenge to the revolutionary process taking place in Venezuela.

													Hamish McLaren"," On Sunday the 3 rd of June Hands off Venezuela attended the CWU conference in Bournmouth. That same evening the CWU executive organised their first â€˜Latin America' fringe meeting. The meeting was chaired and organised by Jane Loftus (now elected president of the union) and was introduced by the union's general secretary Billy Hayes, as an indication of the importance the union gives to international solidarity work. There were speakers representing the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign, Cuba Solidarity Campaign, Justice For Colombia, VICUK and the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The Cuba Solidarity Campaign brought a Cuban doctor, Carlos Dupuy, who had been part of the Cuban medical relief operation in Kashmir. He explained how after the hurricane Katrina hit the United States, the first countries to offer help were Cuba and Venezuela. Carlos himself volunteered to be part of this medical relief team and was ready in a Havana airport, ready to leave at a moment's notice. The United States administration never accepted the offer for help, and finally the contingent was sent to Kashmir. Jorge MartÃ­n, who spoke for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, answered the question from a member of the audience about ""what is socialism of the 21 st century and how is this relevant to workers in Venezuela and abroad"". He explained some of the gains the workers have already made during the Bolivarian revolution (the plan to reduce the working week to 36 hours, the highest minimum wage in Latin America, the announcement of the re-nationalisation of privatised utilities, the setting up of the National Workers' Union, the experiences of workers' control and management, amongst others). Telecommunication workers in audience were particularly pleased to hear about the re-nationalisation of CANTV. Jorge also explained some of the challenges that are still to be tackled for the revolution to be victorious and how ChÃ¡vez and the revolutionary movement were attempting to deal with those. The intervention was a resounding success with the CWU members present displaying a keenness to support the processes in Venezuela. In closing the meeting Jorge replied to the question of how CWU members can help the Bolivarian revolution. He said that the CWU as such has already affiliated to Hands Off Venezuela and that it was now the turn toÂ make sure individual branches and regions of the union also affiliated to the campaign and invited speakers to their meetings. He also added that in the last instance the best way to defend the Bolivarian revolution was to ""prepare the conditions for revolution here"" which was received by an enthusiastic applause.Â Â As well as the fringe meeting we managed to gather 4 pages of signatures in support of the CIPLA workers and raised a considerable amount of money through merchandise sales. The CWU membership was very responsive to the HoV stall and there were many questions on the RCTV licence renewal and bias in the bourgeois press. Generally there was an air of solidarity and support for the workers of Venezuela. ",NA,NA

Ruben gave a passionate speech, interrupted by much applause, in which he explained how the revenues from Venezuelan oil were now being used to alleviate the needs of the poorest in Venezuela. Illiteracy has been eradicated and a high-quality, free health system is now available for all Venezuelans. Ruben invited all FBU members to visit Venezuela to see the revolution with their own eyes. Ruben also denounced the role of imperialism which has attempted to overthrow the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez and which today is trying to discredit the revolution through lies and distortions. He said ""the capitalists were happy when we were giving away our oil to the rich companies and when the money was being put away in American banks. Now that we sell it cheap to the poor of the world, as we did to the poor in the Bronx, so as they can keep warm in winter, they scream blue murder, claiming that we are wasting our resources!""

													Darrall Cozens, HoV Steering Committee and UCU (personal capacity)"," ""The failure of the Bolivarian revolution would be a massive blow not only for the working people of Venezuela but also for the labour movement internationally. That is why the HoV campaign has been and is working in 30 different countries, including Venezuela, to raise the profile of the revolutionary processes taking place in that country and to counter the lies and distortions of the mass media about Venezuela in the UK and elsewhere."" These were the concluding remarks of Darrall Cozens from the HoV campaign when he addressed a packed lunchtime fringe meeting at the NUJ conference in Birmingham on Friday April 13 th . In an hour-long meeting more than 40 delegates listened intently to reports of developments in Venezuela, Cuba and Columbia. From the platform Darrall Cozens began the meeting by reporting on the massive electoral victory of Chavez and the Bolivarian movement in the presidential elections in December 2006. For the 11 th time in succession the masses in Venezuela had demonstrated their support for the programme of the Bolivarian revolution. When Chavez was first elected President in December 1997, he won 56.2% of the vote on a programme of fighting poverty and corruption. In December 2006 he won 63% of the vote on an 82% turnout under the slogan of socialism or death. Despite this massive support for Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution, the Bolivarian government is called an ""elected dictatorship"" and even an ""authoritarian democracy"" by the USA and its allies. Even Tony Blair, who was elected last time by 34% of those voting, some 23% of the electorate, has called on Chavez to obey the wishes of the ""international community"", that is US and UK imperialism. The US had even colluded with the oligarchy in Venezuela in April 2002 to stage a coup to try and overthrow Chavez. Darrall asked the audience a rhetorical question. Why is Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution hated so much by the oligarchy, the rich, in Venezuela and by US and UK imperialism? The answer is obvious. Firstly, the power of the USA in Latin America is being challenged. Since 1823 the USA has operated under the Monroe Doctrine where it declared that it would control what was happening in its back yard, Latin America. Any move in the past to counter the policies and influence of US economic interests has been bloodily suppressed. Guatemala in 1954 and Chile in 1973 are two prime examples. Secondly, the Bolivarian revolution is challenging the power of private property, landlordism and capitalism. Chavez has admitted that when he was first elected, he believed that he could steer a ""third way"" between capitalism and the ""socialism"" that had existed in the Soviet Union. His experiences had proved that there is no middle way. The only way is Socialism of the 21 st century. Thirdly, the revolutionary process that is unfolding has brought into political activity hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who had historically been excluded from the political process. The masses were stamping their feet on the unfolding struggle. During the attempted coup of April 2002, it was the pouring onto the streets of millions of ordinary people that resulted in the coup being stopped and Chavez being returned to power. Finally, the Bolivarian revolution is acting as a beacon of hope for the masses in other countries in Latin America who are suffering under the yoke of the neo-liberal economic policies of capitalist exploitation. On three major occasions there have been attempts to overthrow Chavez and halt the revolutionary process - the attempted coup of April 2002, the oil lockout of December 2002/January 2003 and the recall referendum of August 2004. On each occasion the workers, peasants and marginalised sectors in Venezuela have defeated the counter revolution. More attempts will be made in the future as no privileged group in society has ever given up its power, wealth and privileges without a fight to the bitter end, no holds barred. So it is vital that the international labour movement understands and supports the processes unfolding in Venezuela. The next speaker was Pablo Navarrete a journalist who has recently returned from Venezuela. He gave numerous examples of the pernicious role played by the private media outlets in Venezuela in their attempts to destabilise and overthrow Chavez, even to the extent of calling for the physical elimination of Chavez. What other country in the world would allow its own media to call for the assassination of the elected leaders of that country, he asked. The representative from the Cuban Embassy, Zelmys Rodriguez, highlighted the difficulties that Cuba has faced and is facing due to the international boycott of Cuba initiated by the USA. This boycott even extended to Cuban athletes not being allowed to stay in certain hotels in the world due to the fear of the hotel chain of the retribution that would come from the USA. Despite the boycott, however, Cuba has managed to develop an excellent health and education system, even to the extent of being able to send medical staff to many countries in the developing world as an expression of solidarity and goodwill. The hypocrisy of the USA was demonstrated with the case of Luis Posada Carriles, an international terrorist and ex-CIA operative who is wanted by Cuba and Venezuela for planting a bomb on a plane in 1976 that killed 73 people. This man is in jail in the USA at the moment on immigration charges and is soon to be let out on bail. Where is the war on terror in the USA, the speaker asked. The final speaker from the Justice for Columbia campaign illustrated the dangers faced by trade unionists and activists trying to fight for a better society in Columbia. Many have been assassinated at the hands of paramilitary right-wing death squads linked to the armed forces. Columbia is like the bad kid on the block because almost all of the countries in Latin America were moving to the left, except for Columbia, where the wealth and power of the rich, such as the 6% that owns 80% of the land, is protected by the government. Despite the limited time a lively question and answer session followed that set the scene in the minds of the delegates present for the debate in the conference in the afternoon on Venezuela where once again the NUJ committed itself to continuing to support the work of the Hands off Venezuela campaign.

On May 19 th the Providence, Rhode Island Hands Off Venezuela campaign held the final event in Jorge Martin's Canadian / U.S. speaking tour. Around 25 local workers, students and other activists came to the event which took place at the D.A.R.E. (Direct Action for Rights and Equality) office.  Jorge gave a 45 minute long presentation on the Venezuelan revolution. He explained the turning point that the December 3rd 2006 election played as it marked the overwhelming support the masses have given to the Bolivarian revolution. He also detailed how the interests of the workers, the urban poor, and peasants are opposite of those of the oligarchy and the imperialists, and how this conflict is bringing the living debate about socialism to the forefront. Jorge gave many examples of the capitalists in Venezuela subjecting the whole of the country to a dire situation simply for the sake of private profit: creating food shortages, leaving fertile land idle, not developing an national rail system, lack of housing and many other cases where the people were secondary to profit. He closed the presentation with an appeal to the people who attended to join in the defense of the Venezuelan revolution, to get involved in the HOV campaign, but also as US workers and youth to begin to look down the road toward the American revolution as the only way to really make the Venezuelan and any other revolution truly safe from imperialist intervention.   After the presentation there was time for questions, comments, criticisms etc. and while there weren't any criticisms, there were very many excellent questioned asked. One in particular was raised was of failed revolutions that have taken place in Central America and what lessons could be learned? Jorge explained several of the factors that led to the defeat of these revolutions, and one important one that applies to the Venezuelan revolution: the need to take it to its natural conclusion, that is to finish the revolution by expropriating the social and economic power the oligarchs and imperialists hold and transfer it to all of society under democratic control by the masses.   The mood of the room was extremely upbeat at the end of the meeting; everyone began to discuss further and more informally ask Jorge more questions. Many of the people who attended bought HOV materials, DVDs, and literature. As well, several people expressed interest in helping to build the campaign locally.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," On Tuesday 15 th May Hands off Venezuela travelled to Brighton to attend the annual PCS conference, the 300,000-strong union of civil servants. HoV is an affiliate of PCS and so was granted a stall within the conference centre. At lunchtime on the Wednesday HoV held its fringe meeting, which was attended by 40 trade unionists. The meeting was chaired by Rachel Heemskerk, DWP Regional Chair for the East of England. To begin with a short film was shown of the HoV delegation visit to Sanitarios Maracay, a factory under workers' control. The final few minutes of the film produced a remarkable response from those watching, some of whom mentioned later that they were near tears at seeing the solidarity between the workers and the pride on their faces. Afterwards Rob Sewell spoke on the background of events that led to Chavez being elected in 1998, starting with the Caracazo massacre in 1989. He spoke of the Chavez government's initial endorsement of the â€˜third way', an attempt to find a path between capitalism and socialism, and the frustration this caused both for those honest elements of the Bolivarian movement who were trying to implement reform, and the local stooges of US imperialism who recoiled at these modest measures. Rob continued by explaining the coup of April 2002 as an expression of the irreconcilability of the different class interests of ordinary working people and the local oligarchy. He went on to talk about the development of the revolutionary process since the coup, and especially the recent acceleration in the last 6 months since Chavez was re-elected for the 10 th time in 9 years, including the recent nationalisation of parts of the oil industry which were still in the hands of multinationals. The revolution is not complete however, Rob warned, as the recent attacks on the workers of Sanitarios Maracay illustrate. The revolution cannot stand still, it needs to carry on until its completion or face reaction and counter-attack. This can only be achieved by land reform and the complete nationalisation of the commanding heights of the economy under democratic workers' control. ""Their struggle is our struggle, and our struggle is their struggle"" Rob concluded, urging people to sign the petition in solidarity with the workers of Sanitarios Maracay. Throughout the week 5 pages of signatures were collected from PCS trade unionists wanting to show their support for the Sanitarios Maracay workers and their campaign for nationalisation, of which a PCS and HoV member has taken responsibility for following up. The collection at the fringe meeting raised Â£60. There was also Â£65 worth of material sold to go towards HoV funds, and PCS re-affiliated to Hands Off Venezuela as a union, donating Â£500 to the campaign. On Thursday evening, HoV was invited to a Latin America fringe meeting, sharing the platform with the Venezuelan Information Center (UK), Justice for Colombia and the Cuba Solidarity Campaign. After excellent contributions from our sister campaigns, Pablo Roldan from HoV led off on the significance of the most recent developments since Chavez was re-elected in December. Pablo recalled Chavez's address to the people on election night, when he said that the vote had not been for Chavez, nor the Venezuelan government. It had been a vote for Socialism. Since then Chavez has campaigned for the formation of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and the formation of local community councils, run on a democratic basis, as one of his 5 motors for revolutionary change. He has also recommended the reading of Leon Trotsky's â€˜The Permanent Revolution' and â€˜The Transitional Programme' to all those who are determined to see the revolution defended. As the meeting finished people left with a clear understanding that what is taking place in Venezuela is nothing short of revolutionary change. ",NA,NA

From our HOV correspondent in San Francisco, CA Our HOV-sponsored talk by Jorge Martin was a very successful event. There were approximately 30 present from all age brackets. One could tell that the audience was engaged during the entire presentation since they laughed or even applauded at the appropriate moments. Jorge was flooded with questions and the audience was nodding with appreciation at his answers. At the end, a number of people made it a point to tell us how much they learned. They were very glad they came. Spirited Meeting of Hands Off Venezuela in St. Louis The evening of Saturday, May 12th saw an enthusiastic gathering of nearly 50 people in solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution in St. Louis, MO. The meeting, titled ""The Latin American Revolution - Lessons for U.S. Workers"" featured Jorge Martin, International Secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, as part of his U.S. tour. The meeting was sponsored by the Universal African People's Organization, Gateway Greens, and the Workers International League, and several members of the Organization of Black Struggle were present along with members of KOREZAPA from the Haitian community. Don Fitz of the Gateway Greens gave introductory comments. The meeting was the first public event to be held in the CAMP building on Cherokee street in south St. Louis, which is jointly run by the Gateway Greens and other local organizations. The city government had refused to issue the building a permit to hold public meetings for several years, despite the fact that the right to free assembly is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. So much for democracy in the U.S.! Despite the best efforts of the city government, the first meeting held here was a success and attracted young and old, Black and white who came to learn more about revolution in our hemisphere. Jorge Martin spoke for more than an hour on the history of the Venezuelan Revolution, the dynamics at work in the revolutionary process, and how although the revolution began as a bourgeois-democratic process, it is confronted with distinctly socialist tasks today. This is the permanent revolution at work. He also explained that the Venezuelan workers and peasants are not struggling alone. In Bolivia, Mexico, Ecuador, and across the continent, we have seen the masses mobilized into action, from the campaign against electoral fraud and the Oaxaca commune in Mexico to the recent mass support for a Constituent Assembly in Ecuador. In the past period, Latin America had seen the worst of neo-liberalism, and now the imperialists are reaping the whirlwind. There is not a single stable capitalist regime from the Rio Grande to the Tierra del Fuego. However, the revolutionary process in Venezuela, which stands at the forefront of the Latin American revolution, is far from complete. Many of the most urgent tasks of the revolution have not been carried out - the questions of the State, the economy and the revolutionary party have not been resolved. After the defeat of the oligarchy in December's elections, the main front of struggle for the Venezuelan masses is now within the Bolivarian movement itself, against the pro-capitalist bureaucratic elements who are doing their utmost to steer the revolution into safe channels - safe for capitalism. After Jorge's speech, there were many questions and comments from the floor. The meeting went well past it's alloted time, and despite the fact that it was getting late, those in attendance had trouble tearing themselves away from the discussion. Meetings such as this prove that there is growing support for the Venezuelan masses' struggle for socialism here in the U.S. Ultimately, Jorge explained, the best way to build solidarity with Venezuela is to fight for the socialist revolution here in the U.S - or as they say in Venezuela, in ""the land of the people of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr."" Madison, WI Jorge Martin met in Madison with a group of around 15 Latin America solidarity and immigrant rights activists, many of them organized in the Union of Immigrant Workers (UTI in Spanish). The discussion ranged from an outline of the revolutionary process taking place in Venezuela (which included the granting of citizenship and full rights to some 2 million undocumented Colombians living in the country), to an analysis of the current state of the U.S. immigrant rights movement. It was agreed that the Latin American revolution will not stop at the U.S.-Mexico border, which has profound implications for U.S. imperialism. Everyone present was excited to hear about events that are not reported on in the mainstream media (Univision, the main Spanish-language channel here in the U.S., just happens to be owned by the Cisneros family in Venezuela, who are rabidly against the revolutionary process). The discussion on strategy and tactics in the immigrant workers' movement as part of the working class' world-wide struggle against capitalism and imperialism was wide-ranging and showed how organically inter-connected these questions are.

			[AUDIO] Jorge Martin HOV Tour in Minneapolis",2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela"," Jorge Martinâ€™s North American tour continued with a stop in Minneapolis, MN. On Wednesday, May 16, he attended a demonstration at the Federal building in downtown Minneapolis, to protest the release of Posada Carrilles, an admitted anti-Cuban terrorist. Venezuela wants the CIA-trained operative extradited to stand trial for the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner which killed 73 people. He is also wanted in connection with several other politically motivated bombings across Latin America. Held on immigration charges for illegally entering the country, he has been released by U.S. authorities and is now free to continue plotting and whipping up anti-Castro and anti-Chavez hysteria. The case illustrates the hypocrisy of the U.S. government when it comes to terrorism and immigration. Spanish-language TV station Univision covered the protest, and interviewed Jorge as well as Minneapolis-based HOV activist John Peterson. On Thursday, May 17, Jorge spoke to a crowd of around 25 people in south Minneapolis. His outline of the main gains of the revolution â€“ health care, education, and land reform - as well as a detailed update on events since the December 3 presidential elections, provided the basis for a wide-ranging and intelligent discussion. Everyone in attendance agreed that the best way to defend Venezuela is to work for change here in the U.S. Jorgeâ€™s full speech will be available online soon, both as an audio file, and as a transcript. Eric Angell and Karen Redleaf of SPNNâ€™s â€œOur World In Depthâ€ filmed his speech for future use on local community cable access. We will keep everyone posted on when it airs. Finally, on Friday, May 18, before heading to Providence, RI for the final stop on his 3-week-long tour, Jorge was interviewed on KFAI â€œRadio Without Boundariesâ€. He and John Peterson were featured on host Don Olsonâ€™s â€œNorthern Sun Newsâ€ from 11:30 am to 12:00 noon. Don was well-informed on the situation in Venezuela and asked many questions which Jorge answered in detail. Jorgeâ€™s visit to the Twin Cities was a clear success, and highlighted just how much interest there is in the revolutionary process sweeping not just Venezuela, but the whole of Latin America. We invite everyone in the Twin Cities who is interested in defending Venezuela to get involved with the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. We hold regular meetings not only to organize public events, but to educate ourselves about the latest developments, debates, political and theoretical ideas, etc. that make the Bolivarian Revolution such a dynamic and inspiring process. The next meeting of the Twin Cities Hands Off Venezuela Campaign will be held on Wednesday, May 30 at 7 pm at HOVâ€™s new offices, located at 1304 University Ave. NE, Suite 200 in NE Minneapolis.

			Jorge Martín Tour – Montreal and Québec City",2007-05-10T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Chris Fairon – HOV Canada"," After a strong presence at an anti-imperialist march through downtown Montreal on Saturday, the Hands Off Venezuela team participated in a colloquium on agricultural issues at the University of Quebec at Montreal sponsored by a number of groups active on the agricultural and environmental fronts including the Societe Bolivarienne du Quebec. Jorge Martin gave a presentation which outlined the various challenges Venezuelan farmers had faced before the revolution such as the land resources being monopolized in the hands of a tiny oligarchy, and also showed the necessity of a socialist model for agriculture from an environmental perspective as well. A lively question and answer session followed in which many activists who were not entirely familiar with Venezuela's revolutionary achievements displayed a keen interest in the campaign. The Hands Off Venezuela table received many visitors after the talk, many of whom purchasing DVDs and books on Venezuela and assorted revolutionary topics. Notably present at the event was the Venezuelan consulate in Montreal, who set up a table of literature on various Bolivarian initiatives, as well as copies of the Venezuelan constitution in Spanish, French, English, and Italian. The next leg of the Revolutionary Venezuela tour was scheduled on Monday night for Quebec City, three and a half hours northeast of Montreal. The presentation was sponsored by a cultural centre called Casa Latinoamericana, and drew in a diverse and energized crowd which filled the room to the brink. The crowd took well to Jorge Martin's speech, as he gave a history of Venezuela's radical socio-political transformation from the late 80s onward. Questions of alternatives to capitalism on a global scale struck the right chord with many in Quebec City, as it was in April of 2001 that the city witnessed massive street uprisings in opposition to the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. It was pointed out that at the time, Hugo Chavez was the only leader at the conference to oppose the agreement, and much discussion was initiated over the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). The discussion session was very constructive, as the attendees barraged Jorge with questions about every angle of the Bolivarian revolution. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign table also had a number of people coming forward to discuss politics as well as purchase educational material, despite the lack of books in French. In conclusion, the Quebec wing of the tour was incredibly successful and we would like to extend our gratitude to the Bolivarian Society of Quebec, Casa Latinoamericana, and all of those organizers and activists who have worked with Hands Off Venezuela for their hospitality and solidarity.

			May Day solidarity with Venezuela in Ottawa",2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Julian Benson - HOV Canada"," More than 70 people crowded the lecture hall at the Ottawa public library, Tuesday night, to hear Jorge Martin speak on the Bolivarian Revolution. The event, put on by Hands Off Venezuela and the Marxist magazine ""Fightback,"" had a special significance as it fell on May the 1 st , International Worker's Day. Luis Granados, an activist with both HOV and Fightback, gave an excellent introduction to the situation in Venezuela, recounting his experience there and expressing hope for the revolution. He mentioned his visit to a worker's occupied factory and his talks with the workers there about socialism. Jorge centred his speech precisely around this point. He explained how socialism of the 21 st century meant a socialism free from the Stalinism of the past. To achieve this, he said, it must be built on a solid revolutionary and participatory democracy. President Chavez's calls to ""transfer political, social, economic and administrative power"" to the Communal Councils, so that the ""old structures of the capitalist bourgeois state"" are done away with. Jorge explained that the old state apparatus was designed a build for the purpose of protecting the capitalist status quo and to prevent fundamental change. Fundamental change, however, is precisely what the Venezuelan masses have mobilized to achieve. President Chavez has called for an ""explosion of communal power"" on the basis of a revolutionary democracy from below. Workers' control can played a key role in this process as workers' councils, in co-operation with the community based Communal Councils, are being formed all over the country and they can be used to wrest political, social and economic control away from the oligarchy and redirect in into the hands of the masses. Jorge's speech drew large applause and several members of the audience stood to express their solidarity and support for the Bolivarian revolution. One speaker, however, had quite a different opinion. A man dressed in a suit stood to attack socialism and the Cuban revolution saying, ""According to the Heritage Foundation (!) Cuba has ranked extremely low on the economic freedom index (!!). Also, there are several dozen political prisoners being held in Cuba."" Jorge responded, ""It does not surprise me at all that Cuba ranks low in economic freedom. What kind of freedom is that? Freedom to exploit workers, freedom to rob the poor, freedom for a tiny minority to expropriate the wealth and resources of whole nations for their own gain. And as for the political prisoners, you were too soft on Cuba, there are in fact far more than several dozen; and they face conditions of torture on a daily basis, but they are in fact not prisoners of the Cuba government. Hundreds of people are being held in conditions of torture, completely outside any legal jurisdiction, at the US military base at Guantanamo Bay."" The crowd erupted in applause and cheers. Several Columbian members of the audience explained later that the man in the suit was an agent-provocateur who had the job of disrupting socialist meetings. Clearly he should have been better prepared. HOV would like to thank the Venezuelan Embassy for their support for this excellent meeting in the nation's capital. ",NA,NA

			Jorge Martin speaking tour - Toronto and Hamilton",2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela - Canada"," We were now entering day 4 of Jorge Martin's tour across North America where he was scheduled to speak in Toronto in the evening of May 2. The HOV group arrived in Toronto at 4 in the morning after 5-hour drive from Ottawa where we had had a very successful event. The Toronto meeting, which was organised with the help of Fightback, Ryerson Students Union, and the ""Louis Riel"" Bolivarian Circle, was attended by about 45 people. Notable amongst the audience was the Venezuelan Vice Consul who thanked HOV and others for organizing this tour. Jorge started his speech by referring to the April 2002 coup which was defeated by the people in less than 48 hours, a movement that has never been seen in the history of Latin America, if not the world. This event was a major turning point for the Bolivarian Revolution as it demonstrated the strength of the Venezuelan people. He then continued to talk about the less known oil sabotage in December 2002 that was carried out by the oligarchy and its lackeys who formed the top management levels of the state-owned oil industry, PDVSA. This economic coup was again defeated by the people when the rank-and-file oil workers with the help of the surrounding communities occupied the oil companies and ran the industry by themselves without the managers. This particular event was very important because it showed that if the workers can run the oil industry, which is very advanced from the technological point of view, then the workers can definitely run the whole of the country's economy themselves. Jorge also brought up the fact that Chavez has promoted Trotsky's idea of permanent revolution and recommended the study of Trotsky ideas. This particular point generated many questions and comments from the audience on the nature of the Bolivarian Revolution, the influence of the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky in the course of the revolution, and where it should go. Jorge stressed that the three main challenges facing the Venezuelan revolution were the question of the state apparatus (still a IV Republic capitalist state blocking the initiatives of the revolution, as shown by the attack on Sanitarios Maracay workers), the question of the economy (still largely in hands of the oligarchy and imperialism which use their control of economic power to sabotage the revolution as seen with the sabotage of the food distribution chain) and the question of revolutionary organisation through the building of the Socialist United Party which has already started. All in all the event was a success. It raised the very important question of the nature of ""Socialism in 21 st century"". Workers' occupation in Hamilton The next destination of the tour was Hamilton, a blue-collar city which is at the centre of the manufacturing industry in Ontario. Here in Hamilton, the question of workers' control and factory occupations raised by the actions of workers in Venezuela has become even more relevant. On the very same day as we were holding our event, the workers of Hamilton Specialty Bar occupied the factory. This was in response to the company's move to end about 500 retirees' medical and dental coverage as of Friday, May 4. The occupation ended the next day with a complete victory as the workers won all their demands. A similar workers' occupation took place in Scarborough, Ontario last month, where the auto part workers occupied the plant for 2 days in response to the factory closure that was taking place. Here, Jorge again explained the need to learn from the enormous power of workers' control in Venezuela. While he also reminded the 35 strong audience of workers and youth that one of the main problems of the Bolivarian Revolution is that the economy is not yet fully under workers' control. Questions surrounding the economic organization that the Bolivarian Revolution should embrace were discussed. The issue of arming the people in defense of the revolution was also raised during the discussion. HOV Canada would like to thank the Hamilton Skydragon Centre for organizing the Hamilton event; and the Bolivarian Circle ""Louis Riel"", Ryerson Students Union and Fightback for organizing the Toronto event.

													Hands Off Venezuela Canada"," On Monday, May 7 th nearly 50 people came out to the Vancouver stop of the Jorge Martin tour. Jorge spoke for an hour about the history of the Bolivarian revolution, detailing the events surrounding the coup and the lockout. He also detailed Chavez's new turn towards socialism and the building of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. He explained that there are three main challenges facing the Venezuelan revolution today. One - the economy is still owned and controlled by the oligarchy allowing them to sabotage the revolution, two - the old capitalist state is still in control allowing layers of the bureaucracy to sabotage the revolution from within and three - there is no unified revolutionary organization that the masses can organize and educate themselves through. This was followed by a lively discussion with topics ranging everywhere from capitalism's inability to solve the environmental crisis to the role of Cuba in the Bolivarian revolution. There was tremendous enthusiasm and excitement about the events taking place in Latin America. As Jorge put it ""For the first time in generations, our side is winning!"" The enthusiasm of the crowd was shown by the money raised through the collection. Despite having just under 50 people at the event, over $225 was collected to help fund the tour and the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The success of the Jorge Martin tour in Vancouver and across Canada is a sign of things to come. As the revolutionary process in Latin America deepens, the solidarity movement will grow.

													Ben Martin – HOV Canada"," Tuesday, May 8 th marked the birth of Hands Off Venezuela in Victoria, British Colombia. Jorge Martin came to the University of Victoria during the evening to a crowd of some twenty people to educate about the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, including its achievements and its obstacles. The event was well received and many of the questions from the audience were in-depth and displayed a high interest in both Venezuela and socialism. Jorge began the evening by marking the tremendous gains that the Chavez government has accomplished in education, health care, political involvement of the masses, and more. Both socialism and Canadian attempts to stifle the revolution in Venezuela were the hot topics of the evening. Jorge detailed Chavez' transformation from first attempting to find a ""third way"" between capitalism and socialism and later realizing that the only way to fundamentally change society for the better is to implement socialism - which would mean a democratically planned economy, the nationalization of key sectors of the economy, doing away with the old and outdated state structures which only represent the interests of the elites, and uniting the country around a solid program for change, all of which are on their way to being accomplished in Venezuela. He also spoke about the lies in the Canadian and American media which try to portray Hugo Chavez as a deranged dictator. Nothing could be further from the truth, considering that he has been freely and fairly elected on eleven different occasions, including elections and referendums! Jorge also mentioned that the Canadian government has both donated tens of thousands of dollars to anti-Chavez groups in Venezuela, and also - like the United States government - had prior knowledge of the 2002 coup that briefly ousted Chavez from power for forty-eight hours. This sparked great interest in the audience and was a key topic of the evening, as many members of the crowd desired to know more in order to hold their elected representatives in Ottawa accountable for such backhanded and secretive action. Jorge Martin concluded his speech by proclaiming that a fundamental change in society is taking place in Venezuela and it is one that the Canadian people can take many lessons and examples from. After all, if a South American country can give its people free and universal health care and education (including post-secondary) as well as directly extend the political arena to every individual, then why can't Canada? Working people in Victoria and Canada should struggle here at home for these things as well. Debate and discussion lasted for quite some time after the event. The Bolivarian Revolution clearly has plenty of support in the Victoria area and many people were very informed about the struggle for socialism in Latin America. Hands Off Venezuela in Victoria would like to thank the Victoria in Solidarity with Venezuela group for supporting the event. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela - Canada"," On a cold and drizzly Saturday afternoon, just fewer than 150 people assembled for a demonstration organized by the April 28 th coalition under the slogans ""NO to Canadian-US imperialism from Port-Au-Prince to Caracas; YES to social change and the Bolivarian process throughout Latin America!"" In solidarity, the organizers called on the participants to dress in red; and, despite the rain and cold weather, red was seen throughout the crowd. Around 1 o'clock the demonstrators gathered in a park off Sherbrooke avenue, with Hands Off Venezuela very visible with a large banner and an impressive presence. The activists present showed great interest in the Venezuelan revolution and purchased several of our French-language document ""Marxists and the Venezuelan revolution"". The debate over Venezuela has in recent days shifted to one about the nature of socialism and revolution and, more importantly, how to build a similar revolutionary movement in Canada. An important presence at the demonstration was the Canada-Haiti action network, whose speaker, Yves Engler, correctly drew links between anti-imperialist struggles in Haiti and those throughout the Americas. We were able to take a front-and-centre role at the march, initiating many chants and getting many demonstrators talking. The diversity of political and cultural activists, despite the relatively small size of the demonstration, was rather impressive: the Quebec-Cuba solidarity committee had a speaker, as did a member of the Montreal Iranian Socialist Unity. Hands Off Venezuela played a large role in engaging with this diverse crowd and sharing perspectives with a good number of activists. Also noticeable was the clearly anti-capitalist character of the march, with every group represented explicitly identifiable as socialist. Colouring this otherwise grey afternoon was a sea of bright red flags. The influence of Venezuela amongst activists in Montreal was quite clear. Many who had previously never seriously considered socialism before are now showing great interest in Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky. The best and most advanced elements of the activist communities have been pushed, by the force of events, to becoming vocal advocates of socialism. The international secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, Jorge Martin, played on this theme during his speech to the crowd. He noted that Chavez himself did not start off as a socialist, he put forward simple, modest demands, but even these were too radical to be achieved under capitalism. Chavez became a socialist by realizing that only the overthrow of capitalism can solve the everyday injustices in the world today. In Quebec, and around the world, many are learning this same lesson. In closing, Jorge ended by saying that the best way to support the revolution in Latin America, is to create the conditions for revolution in your own country. We would like to thank the SociÃ©tÃ© Bolivarienne du QuÃ©bec for their marvellous hospitality and above all for their great effort in organising the solidarity movement. ",NA,NA

													Charley Allan - Morning Star"," From Morning Star, Friday April 27 2007 BRENT trades council pledged solidarity with workers at an occupied bathroom ceramics factory in Venezuela on Wednesday night. The council, which is involved in the Wembley Park city academy land occupation, voted unanimously to support the struggle of workers at Sanitarios Maracay, which has been occupied since last November. Members of the council, many of whom are veterans of the Grunwick dispute 30 years ago, also agreed to send Â£100 to the workers, who are asking the government to nationalise the factory under workers' control. A lively question and answer session followed three short films introduced by Sheila Robin, who explained that the owner - a participant in the 2002 coup - had shut the factory to break a collective bargaining agreement. Ms Robin, who visited the factory last December as part of a international delegation organised by Hands Off Venezuela, explained: ""The revolution in Venezuela is an inspiration to workers all over the world and it's important to build links directly with grass-roots movements there."" She added that international solidarity was especially vital as there had been incidents of repression against the workers, including the arrest of 21 people travelling to a national occupied factories demonstration the day before. The council voted ""to support the calls for the resignation of state governor Didalco Bolivar"" over the issue. As the meeting ended, news came through that all the prisoners had been released.

			Hands Off Venezuela screening of ¡Salud!",2007-03-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Melanie MacDonald - Hands Off Venezuela London"," A crowd of 72, mostly students, crammed in room 364 of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to watch the documentary Â¡Salud! by award winning filmmaker Connie Field. The film chronicles the amazing achievements of the Cuban health system at home and the impact its outreach programs have had in Venezuela and around the world despite having few health care dollars to spend and little resources. Since its beginnings with the 1959 revolution, Cuba's health system has brought the health of the island's inhabitants up to world class standards. We were all surprised to discover Cuba has a lower infant mortality rate than the United States. The film illustrates how Cuba's international cooperation plan has made all the difference in countries such as Gambia, South Africa, Honduras and Venezuela. It shows how the basis of the Cuban Health model is in the integration of practice and teaching directly in the community. It is health care for the community and by the people from the community - no matter what their class, income or how remote an area they might live in. It stresses the idea that health care is a human right, not a privilege only for the rich. It was shown that this style of health socialization builds a strong relationship between the doctor and patient but also, builds a sense of reciprocity that the patient will take care and participate in their own preventative health care. This focus on keeping people healthy produces dramatic results in the reduction of disease and the saving of lives compared to the ""sick-care"" style practiced here in the UK. Everyone agreed it was a film well worth seeing! Nearly 40 people signed up to be added to the London HoV mailing list. Should you be interested in hosting your own screening and discussion of the important issues raised in Â¡Salud! in your school, trade union or community just contact Hands Off Venezuela for a copy of the film and/or a speaker.

			Debate on Venezuela at Bristol Latin American Forum 2007",2007-03-14T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Will Roche, Hands Off Venezuela"," This year the University of Bristol hosted its second Latin American Forum organised by a coalition of solidarity campaigns. Around 120-150 people filled the lecture rooms to debate and discuss the revolutionary social movements that are currently sweeping across Latin America. A variety of workshops and films explored strategies against the neo-liberal agenda, ""which has imposed a series of devastating 'reforms', a term now being used by capitalist governments and multinationals as a code word for counter-reforms"", explained Martin Silvers from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign, ""repealing welfare systems, and privatising industry. The problem is that deregulation and privatisation don't work! It has led to massive drops in living standards and working conditions."" ""Is this really what 'modernisation' brings us,"" asked Jose Sagaz from the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign. Jose explained that privatisation of their already corrupt gas industry had reduced revenue into the state from $350milion to a pathetic $50million. The rest went into the pockets of British Petroleum and Repsol amongst others. He also presented a very powerful video explaining the development of the revolutionary struggle of the workers and peasants in Bolivia, particularly the uprisings in October 2003 and May-June 2005 which eventually led to the election of the Evo Morales government in December 2006. Multinationals continue to loot Colombia, aided and abetted by its pro-Washington government, reported Richard Solly from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign, at huge social and environmental costs. However, at the forefront of the discussions was the revolutionary wave of resistance that is being built in reaction to these attacks. The people of Latin America are commonly of the opinion that capitalism has nothing more to offer them, and that what is needed is a new type of system where the common people hold power and control over the running of society. One of the ideas discussed at the Forum was what Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has called Socialism of the 21st Century . In the workshop on Venezuela, Jorge Martin from the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign used the example of the struggle of Sanitarios Maracay , which he said, ""represents the most effective strategy against capitalist exploitation"". The workers are proving that they can run even the most advanced industries by themselves. The case of the Venezuelan oil workers proved this in 2002. Jorge also explained that the cooperative model can be very progressive, but that it doesn't necessarily solve the problem of profit orientated private business. Many workers in Venezuela, like those of the occupied Sanitarios Maracay are calling for full nationalisation of the economy to be democratically run under workers' control. This is what they understand as socialism of the 21st century. Another well-attended workshop was the one on Cuban hip-hop, with the presence of veteran Cuban hip-hop groups, ObsesiÃ³n and Los Paisanos. Their members answered questions about the discrimination against women in hip-hop and Cuban culture in general, explained how theirs was conscious hip-hop to be used as a revolutionary tool of struggle, discussed issues of censorship and finally insisted that their main hope for the future was ""the lifting of the embargo on Cuba"", stressing they were part of the revolution. The workshop on Venezuela was extremely well attended and was complemented by another workshop by Thomas Muhr PhD from University of Bristol, on the changes in Higher Education in Venezuela. He explained the impact of the education misiones and particularly how the Bolivarian University was taking higher education into poor and working class communities around the country. The subject of Socialism of the 21st Century was raised again at the well attended closing session, where the Venezuelan Ambassador, Alfredo Toro-Hardy, gave a long fact filled speech, and answered many questions from an inspired audience. Venezuela is one of the only countries in Latin America where recent polls showed that a majority of its population was satisfied with the levels of democracy, Alfredo explained. On the question of mass media manipulation, Alfredo spoke of the importance of the emerging alternative media. And, on the question of Cuba, the Ambassador stated that the Cuban revolution has been fundamental to the future of Latin America, and that he greatly respected the Cuban example. The Ambassador went on to say that ""If socialism means putting human needs first, then I am a socialist."" This Forum was a great success, and shows continued growing interest in revolutionary politics, attracting young and old and bringing cultures together at a time when many feel that our own political system in the west is breaking down.

			Hands Off Venezuela London celebrates 5th anniversary of defeated coup",2007-04-16T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," On the night of the fifth anniversary of President ChÃ¡vez's return to power, Hands Off Venezuela gathered supporters in central London to celebrate the defeat of the April 13th coup d'etat, with music, video and live performance. The event, which was titled The Revolution Was Not Televised, brought together activists with people who wouldn't normally be motivated to attend a political meeting. The Latin American-themed Masque bar in King's Cross was the perfect venue for this intimate underground gathering. The evening kicked off with some of the many revolutionary songs produced in Venezuela over the last eight years - from updated versions of the classic 'Uh! Ah! ChÃ¡vez No Se Va!' by Groupo Madera to Cristobal Jimenez via 'Y Bajaron' by Lloviznando Cantos, interspersed with ChÃ¡vez samples mixed over Reggaeton beats. A short film grabbed the crowd's attention as some present were witnessing the events leading to the 2002 coup in Venezuela for the first time. HOV international secretary Jorge Martin then addressed the crowd on the importance of highlighting this event in history. Jorge reminded the crowd that there is a long tradition of coups being implemented in South America and stressed that this coup failed, not because it was badly organised, but due to the manifested revolutionary spirit of the majority of the Venezuelan people. Consciousness-raising DJs then went on to play Venezuelan and Latin American music as well as choice cuts including Gil Scott-Heron's seminal 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised', from which the name of the famous coup documentary came from. JC Kamau then performed some spoken-word poetry, covering subjects such as the effects of globalisation and poverty throughout the world. His down-to-earth and honest persona warmed him to the crowd instantly. He was followed by David J, who amazed the crowd with his fast-flow acappellas and improvisations. He finished on a very poignant note with a song about a friend who died, literally around the corner from the location in King's Cross during the 7/7 bombings in London two years ago and the insanity of that situation. With people continuing to show up later in the evening, the spirit of solidarity and action was kept alive until the small hours, with plenty of seeds having been sown in the minds of people previously unaware of the real revolutionary nature of the process in Venezuela. It was important to mark this date in history and the Hands Off Venezuela campaign did so successfully, as they continue to work tirelessly in defence of the Bolivarian Revolution in Britain and throughout the world.

			Anniversary of the Caracazo",2007-02-22T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," This week marks the anniversary of the events known as the ""Caracazo"", where the government of President Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez called on the army to put down a mass uprising. According to the government, ""only"" 276 people died in the attempt to ""restore order"". Soon afterwards, mass graves were discovered. It is now recognised that at least 3,000 people were killed, though some put the figure as high as 10,000. This event sparked off what became known later as the Bolivarian Revolution led by Hugo ChÃ¡vez. ChÃ¡vez himself was elected as president in 1998. However, on April 11, 2002, ChÃ¡vez was overthrown by a military coup. This coup was organized by the Venezuelan oligarchy and backed by American imperialism. Fortunately, this attempted counter-revolution was defeated by the spontaneous movement of the masses. On the first day of the coup, a mass oppositionist rally against ChÃ¡vez had been called at the headquarters of the national oil company, PDVSA. The oppositionist leaders decided to march on the Presidential Palace. Soon afterwards, all the private TV channels in Venezuela were broadcasting images of ChÃ¡vez supporters shooting from Llaguno Bridge into an unarmed opposition demonstration. These images were used as a pretext to launch the coup. The imperialists, including the British government, welcomed the coup ""to restore the democratic government"". In fact, the new president installed briefly by the coup, Pedro Carmona Estanga, suspended the constitution and dissolved every democratic institution in the country. Only later did the truth come out. The killing at Puente Llaguno had been carefully planned by the coup plotters in order to justify (before international public opinion) their actions. They had organized these murders in advance. Only afterwards was the role of the private media corporations exposed. An astonishing film documentary has been reconstructed about these amazing events. ""PUENTE LLAGUNO: KEYS OF A MASSACRE"" is a must-see, in-depth analysis of that day and the role of the private media in the class struggle in Venezuela. Today, due to their role in the coup, the Bolivarian government has decided not to renew the RCTV channel's broadcasting license. This has created an international controversy.

			Big enthusiasm for Venezuelan revolution in Denmark",2007-02-20T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Denmark"," Hands Off Venezuela in Denmark launched a speaking tour, beginning on February 14, with Patrick Larsen, a journalist who has lived in Venezuela and worked for the Venezuelan Marxist paper, El Militante . Unfortunately, not much is known about Venezuela in Denmark. One can, however, read an editorial almost every week in the mainstream press hammering the Bolivarian revolution and president Chavez. Many people are therefore curious to know what is really going on in Venezuela and why its president is denouncing Bush in such violent terms in the UN council, etc. The speaking tour organised by Hands Off Venezuela Denmark, with its modest resources, has been very successful. To date meetings have been held in four different cities across the country, and three more meetings have been planned for the coming week. The first meeting took place in Vejle, a small city in the western part of Denmark. The meeting, which was organised together with Socialistisk Ungdomsfront (SUF) in Vejle, gathered some 20 people. Both young students and former militants of the Communist Party had come to hear about the exciting revolutionary process. Â Patrick Larsen gave a detailed account based on his experiences during his stay in the country, both explaining the background of the revolution and the concrete struggles going on in the country, the movement of occupied factories, the trade union situation, the struggles of the landless peasants, etc. He explained that the basic reason for this revolutionary upsurge was to be found in the fact that capitalism has failed completely in the whole of Latin America. It is urgently necessary that capitalism be finished off in Venezuela if the problems of the masses are to be solved. After this introduction, the famous documentary ""The revolution will not be televised"" was screened in a small cinema. This film, an amazing live account of the failed coup in 2002, found a very good response in the audience. People were very impressed with the film and the lecture and one person remarked jokingly afterwards ""well, are we going to storm the regional council now?"". (In the documentary thousands of Venezuelans gather around the Miraflores palace to overthrow the coup-plotters.) Â The meeting in Copenhagen was the most important achievement so far. Hands Off Venezuela had taken the initiative to call a broad meeting, inviting all sections of the left, visiting trade union centres and inviting them to come, going to the universities, etc. The whole Saturday was dedicated to this event in order to give a good and thorough introduction to the Venezuelan revolution and to allow different groups to give their opinion. Fifty people showed up for the meeting. There were people from Colombia and Chile and also the Venezuelan ambassador was present and thanked the organisers deeply for making the event possible. Two comrades from Hands Off Venezuela in Sweden had also taken the trouble to come to Copenhagen and they made a small intervention in the debate, explaining their experiences during their trip to Venezuela in December 2006. Â There were interventions by Christine Lundgaard from International Forum, Pelle Dragsted from Enhedslisten (The Red-Green Alliance) and Patrick Larsen from Socialistisk Standpunkt. Again, the documentary ""The revolution will not be televised"" was screened and many people asked us how to get copies. The discussions focused on how to accelerate the revolution and how to avoid any new attempts at a coup d'Ã©tat. What will happen if, for example, Chavez is assassinated by some elements of the opposition? Some people asked if there is any kind of party or revolutionary force that will be able to hinder a new coup or be able to unite the movement if Chavez is assassinated. Patrick Larsen, in his response, said that there are forces that have been mobilising to build a defence against the counter-revolution. This was the case for example, when a number of left-wing Bolivarian organisations, including the FNCEZ (The Front of Landless and Poor Peasants) and FRETECO (the movement of occupied factories), made an alliance called ""Oligarcas temblad"" (Oligarchs Tremble!), during the December elections last year. Their basic aim was to form a united front that would mobilise the masses if any attempt to destabilise the Chavez government were made. Â Another question raised at the meeting was the new Enabling Law that allows Chavez to rule by decree. In the mainstream media this law has been portrayed as ""proof"" of Chavez's dictatorial tendencies. Unfortunately, some people on the left have jumped on the bandwagon and are now opposed to this law. Patrick explained that the Enabling laws are not a new thing in Venezuelan politics, and that many governments - including the ChÃ¡vez government - have used this method in the past. Secondly, the law is seen as a revolutionary measure by the Venezuelan masses, who view it as a way of speeding up the nationalisations. In such a situation it is completely incorrect to argue for a ""sovereign parliament"" and oppose this law. What revolutionaries should do is to build a revolutionary democracy from below that can guarantee that this new law is used to push the revolution forward. The meeting ended in a good and comradely spirit and many people signed up to join the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Smaller meetings were held with the SUF branches in Aalborg, Albertslund and Vesterbro. In those meetings there was a lot of interest in the revolution and a lot of questions about its background and peculiarities. In one of them, we were able to show videos from Sanitarios Maracay, a factory in Venezuela under workers' control. The pictures of radicalised workers discussing how to manage the factory and deciding everything themselves served once again to animate the audience. Denmark is generally seen as a quiet and prosperous country. But recently things have changed and significant sectors of the working class have been involved in long strike action. The level of enthusiasm that the Hands Off Venezuela speaking tour has aroused can only be explained by the fact that many people are inspired by a revolutionary alternative. ",NA,NA

													Daniel Morley"," Alan Woods' stirring speech and coherent argument at a meeting of about 150 people at the UEA massively boosted the interest of students and youth in the Venezuelan Revolution, thus proving the huge potential in this 21st century revolution for invigorating and giving hope to the workers and youth of the world. Venezuela is the key to the world revolution and the alternative this offers to people everywhere who are sick and tired of the status quo, and the sense of hope, empowerment and the need to know more and help extend the Revolution that this key event engenders was typified at the meeting by a series of questions based mainly on the theme of ""How can this be continued and furthered?"" ""Is there a danger the enthusiasm will fade?"" and ""Can Venezuela survive on its own?"", and also by the unprecedented (at UEA at least) numbers of books and journals sold. In the run up to Alan's meeting we had a successful meeting led off by Rob Sewell on Venezuela and Trotskyism, and it looks as if the continuing work towards highlighting the issue is paying off. Hopefully we can now build a series of important meetings and events to raise awareness of the key questions, such as workers' control and link the Revolution to Britain, through HOV and John McDonnell's campaign. Aptly, the meeting was held on the day of student elections (which more often than not take the form of popularity contests, with candidates handing out sweets as a bribe for votes) which were preceded by a debate and public question time between the various candidates, garnering an audience of twelve! The contradiction between the scales of the two meetings is a brilliant metaphor for why apathy towards bourgeois politics exists, and how revolution is the only way to change this. All this reflects two things - that the Venezuelan Revolution truly is the key to the world revolution and a fantastic draw for the youth, and that â€˜patiently explaining', consistent work, honesty and discussion are the best and only methods for building solidarity with it. We must build on this success and make Norwich a stronghold for Hands off Venezuela. This is the best and most concrete way to defend the Venezuelan Revolution! Viva La RevoluciÃ³n! A student captured the whole talk on his mobile phone and uploaded the video footage to the internet.

			London - Successful commemoration of the 18th anniversary of the “Caracazo”",2007-03-01T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Francesco Merli"," February 27 marked the 18 th anniversary of the popular uprising known as the Caracazo , which took place in 1989 in Venezuela. The spontaneous movement of the mass of the Venezuelan poor (80% of the population lived below the poverty line at that time) was provoked by a sharp increase of all basic food, energy, fuel and transport prices by 200% as a consequence of a neo-liberal package deal introduced by the government of President Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez. The massive movement, although lacking of any organised leadership, immediately took an insurrectionary character, threatening the very foundations of the capitalist system: private property. The response of the supposedly democratic government was to call on the army to put down the mass uprising, opening fire on men, women and children in the streets and storming the poorest neighbourhoods of the main Venezuelan cities with bullets, particularly in the capital where hundreds of dead bodies were left laying in the streets. According to the government ""only"" 276 people died in the attempt to ""restore order"". Soon afterwards, mass graves were discovered. It is now recognised that at least 3,000 people were killed, though some put the figure as high as 10,000. This event marked the complete alienation of the mass of the Venezuelan people from the so-called democratic regime of the Fourth Republic and sparked off what became known later as the Bolivarian Revolution led by Hugo ChÃ¡vez, which began as a reaction of a section of young army officers repelled by the very idea that the army could have slaughtered its own people. Knowledge of this massacre has been buried by the same international media that now hysterically call ChÃ¡vez a dictator. In Venezuela, the whole of the private and state media consistently backed the government's version of events. Only the heroic work of a handful of independent journalists and media activists was finally able to reveal the real size and scope of the repression. Hands Off Venezuela and Cine Urgente organised an important event in London on February 26 to commemorate the Caracazo and to discuss the role of capitalist media in society. The event was held in Bolivar Hall at the Venezuelan Embassy, thanks to the support of the Venezuelan Ambassador, Alfredo Toro Hardy. The focus of the screenings and the debate was the strikingly similar role played by the media in relation to the Caracazo and during the April 11, 2002 coup against ChÃ¡vez. These events demonstrate that the capitalist media consistently defend the interests of the ruling class whenever they are put at risk, no matter who is in office at that particular moment in time. The event was opened by Pedro Laya, Venezuelan director and producer (Cine Urgente), who explained the important role played by the independent media in defending the truth and denouncing the official versions of events in both 1989 and 2002. The opening speech was followed by the screening of a short video, cut by the HoV Media Centre, with original footage of the Caracazo . Jorge Martin, international secretary of HoV, then provided the audience with an explanation of the real meaning of the Caracazo in the development of the Bolivarian Revolution and of the events that led to the April 2002 coup against ChÃ¡vez. The background information paved the way for the screening of the documentary ""Llaguno Bridge - Keys to a Massacre"". The documentary, produced by the Venezuelan National Association of Free, Community and Alternative Media, analyses and discloses the mechanism of the conspiracy that led to the April 11 coup. In particular it reveals the shameful record of the capitalist media, their key role in the coup plot and their instrumental use of the Llaguno Bridge massacre against the government. On the first day of the coup, a mass opposition rally against ChÃ¡vez had been called at the headquarters of the national oil company, PDVSA This rally was meant as demonstration against the government's decision to claim back state control of Venezuela's most important asset - PDVSA. The opposition leaders decided to march on the Presidential Palace. Soon afterwards, all the private TV channels in Venezuela were broadcasting images of ChÃ¡vez supporters shooting from Llaguno Bridge into an unarmed opposition demonstration. These images were used as a pretext to launch the coup. The imperialists, including the British government, welcomed the coup ""to restore the democratic government"". In fact, the new president installed briefly by the coup, Pedro Carmona Estanga, suspended the constitution and dissolved every democratic institution in the country. It was only later that the truth came out. The killings at Puente Llaguno had been carefully planned by the coup plotters in order to justify their actions before international public opinion. They had organized these murders in advance. More than 80 people attentively followed the whole event showing a great interest in the screenings. A lively session of debate and discussion followed the screenings with questions relating to the actual position and the perspectives of the Venezuelan Revolution after landslide victory of ChÃ¡vez in the Presidential election on December 3. Another issue highlighted in the debate was the decision taken by the Bolivarian government not to renew RCTV's broadcasting license, due to the role this TV station played in the coup. This move on the part of the government is not meant as a blow against ""free press"" but, on the contrary, as a means of giving the Venezuelan people broader and free access to the media. The meeting ended in a general mood of enthusiasm and most of the participants showed keen interest in following up the activities of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. ",NA,NA

A David Bos, Presbyterian Minister To all religious leaders, We are writing to ask you to become part of a growing worldwide campaign to stop the sale of a violent video game in which the player leads a mercenary force into Venezuela with the objective of killing a ""power hungry tyrant"" who has taken over the oil industry. The game, ""Mercenaries 2,"" is produced by Pandemic Studios which has been subcontracted to create extremely realistic videos to be used as training games for the U.S. military. Pandemic Studios uses the same technology found in the training videos to make the scenes in ""Mercenaries 2"" as realistic as possible. Anyone who has spent time in Caracas can immediately recognize the city's streets and landmarks in the game. The aim of the video game is full devastation, so any ""person"" who moves should be ""shot,"" and all the buildings, such as the headquarters of PDVSA, the Venezuelan public oil company, can be ""destroyed."" Our concern is that this game will only deepen an already antagonistic relationship between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments. Millions of Venezuelans fear an invasion from the U.S.; knowing that a company that works for the U.S. military has created a game in which their country is completely destroyed will increase those concerns. To promote the campaign, we are approaching one of the principal investors in Pandemic Studios, Bono, lead singer for U2 and one of Time's 2005 People of the Year, to ask him to use his considerable influence to stop the sale of the game. Bono is one of six members of Elevation Partners which has invested $300 million in Pandemic Studios. We hope that his history of involvement in justice issues such as debt and famine relief will sensitize him to the problems with this game.

We applaud your efforts to erase the plagues of debt and famine from our planet and hope 2007 will bring new energy and advances in these struggles. We write with the hope that, while addressing these significant international issues, you will also use your considerable influence in a matter that is closer to home - a violent video game that has the potential to increase tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela while promoting violence in our communities. Our faith traditions motivate us to confront the international debt problem that robs human dignity and calls us to counter the culture of violence that pervades our society today. The celebration of violence in much of our media, music and video games is poisoning our children. Games such as ""Mercenaries 2"" only serve to deepen the alienation that already exists in our society, creating fear that drives people away from each other. As people of faith, we are called to a different way of life. ""Mercenaries 2"" is an extremely realistic and vicious game in which the player leads a mercenary team to kill a ""power hungry tyrant"" that has taken control of oil supplies in Venezuela. Images of downtown Caracas are depicted as being completely destroyed during the game, and any ""people"" on the streets are to be killed. Pandemic Studios, a company in which your investment partnership has financed hundreds of millions of dollars, is the creator of this game. Behavioral science research demonstrates that playing violent video games increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior, particularly in children and youth. A game like ""Mercenaries 2"" in which the player assumes the role of killer in scenes that appear very life-like is even more likely to provoke aggressiveness. Of equal concern is the fact that the game inevitably will provoke increased tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. Pandemic Studios has made a similar training game for the U.S. military. This fact is not overlooked by Venezuelans, who see this as further evidence of U.S. government hostility toward their country. We ask that you do whatever is necessary to see that ""Mercenaries 2"" is pulled from stores and not sold anywhere. We also ask you to reconsider your investment in a company that glorifies violence and militarization. Most of our organizations have reconsidered past investments in companies involved in life-draining activities and have reoriented our investments to support more life-encouraging companies. We hope that you will consider the same. We feel your connection with this game detracts from your image as a human rights defender. In the end, to paraphrase a statement of yours, we all know that history, like God, is watching what you do. We look forward to your response and would welcome a meeting to discuss these concerns further.

			Venezuelan trade union leader enthuses Belgian solidarity movement",2007-01-30T00:00:00Z,"
															
													a Hands Off Venezuela correspondent in Belgium"," Exceptional are those foreign trade union leaders who after an exhausting trip of twenty hours decide to go directly from the airport to the picket line of the striking Volkswagen workers. Ruben Linares is just such a trade unionist, one of those truly internationalist trade union leaders who have been steeled in the turbulent process of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela. Ruben Linares is one of the national coordinators of the new trade union federation UNT and also the president of the transport federation, the FNTT. He visited Belgium in the second week of December to take part in a national day of solidarity on December 9, but also to establish links with the Belgian trade unions. It was a short but quite intense visit between December 6 and 15. When we decided to go the Volkswagen picket line a little doubt entered our mind: how would these workers who had just been brutally treated and lost their jobs react to the presence of Ruben at their picket? The workers had organised a special activity for that afternoon, with the distribution of sweets and presents for their children, a traditional event that takes place in Belgium on December 6. We were introducing Ruben to some of the workers when we came across a group of Moroccan workers from a subcontracting firm, ISS. They immediately ""took charge"" of looking after Ruben Linares. ""You want a cup of hot chocolate?"" ""Yes, thanks,"" answered a freezing Ruben. None of those workers was a trade union activist or a shop steward but all of them were aware of what is happening in Venezuela. Ruben was concerned that we should express the solidarity of Venezuelan workers, but he was then besieged with questions and words of support for the Venezuelan revolution! ""Viva Chavez"" was the spontaneous reaction of a group of workers. ""Well done in Venezuela. Give Bush a kick up his ****."" ""If we had a Chavez (in Morocco or the Arab world) we would never have been forced to emigrate looking for a job elsewhere. In Belgium as well as in our homeland we suffer. Redistribute the wealth, that is what is necessary"". It is remarkable how quickly Chavez has become a hero for the Arab people. We got a photo taken with the whole group. By then we were getting noticed on the picket! Some trade union activists came up and congratulated Linares for Chavez's election victory in Venezuela. A few moments later we were discussing with the shop stewards belonging to the socialist trade union confederation. They explained: ""Believe it or not, but exactly this morning during a demonstration we were discussing what was going on in Venezuela. We concluded that the Bolivarian revolution is the one of the most important developments for the left internationally."" Here again the workers didn't give Ruben a chance to express his solidarity with their struggle, but immediately expressed their solidarity with the struggle in Venezuela! A former shop steward, Jacques Guillemot, immediately started giving his view of the world situation and the role of the Bolivarian revolution. Another one fired one question after the other. We distributed invitations for the national day of solidarity that were eagerly read. The cold was starting to really to bite by now. We warmed up near the fire, the ‘brasero,' and went back home. That same evening different comrades from the solidarity movement welcomed Ruben to Belgium. We discussed until late at night. The next day Ruben was expected to speak at the local university, where some student organisations had organised an activity for him, and despite the exam fever a group of 20 youth participated in the debate. On the Friday afternoon Ruben Linares together with Gregory Wilpert, the co-founder of Venezuelanalysis.com, had been invited to speak to Oxfam Solidarity. Again some 20 cadres of the movement turned up for the meeting. Oxfam Solidarity is one of the few NGOs (non government organisations) in Belgium that has understood the importance of the Bolivarian Revolution. By spreading information and offering practical participation in solidarity events, Oxfam Solidarity helps in combating the stubborn prejudices against the Bolivarian revolution. The central and inspiring role of Ruben Linares during the national day of solidarity has been described in another article. The following day we heard of the death of Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator. When Ruben took part in the celebrations of the Chilean community in the centre of town he stood out because of his typical Venezuelan humour. ""Nobody really knows why Pinochet died this week, but I know why. It was the news of Chavez's mega victory last week that killed him"". When Ruben and dozens of other Chileans enter a café later in the evening they get a great reception with the songs of the Unidad Popular government of Allende and extracts from speeches of Chavez and Che Guevara. On Tuesday Ruben met the general secretary of the Flemish socialist union ABVV, Caroline Coopers. Following the discussion at the national congress of the socialist ABVV/FGTB in June 2006, the union had decided to establish contacts with the UNT. This was thanks to the intervention and the campaign launched by an important branch of the socialist union of Chemical, Oil and Building Workers in Antwerp. Last year this union affiliated to the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The long meeting with Ruben Linares and Caroline Coopers is the concrete result of that decision. Ruben gave a panoramic view of the trade union situation, explained the scandalous role of the corrupt CTV leaders during the coup in 2002 against Chavez and during the bosses' lockout. Ruben also gave a lot of examples of the developments of the UNT and he answered also the reports of the International Labour Organisation rejecting the idea that there were any restrictions on trade union rights in Venezuela. At the end of this meeting, Ruben had no doubt that this first and important meeting will have a positive influence on the attitude of the socialist union towards the UNT and the Bolivarian revolution. A few hours later we met another trade union leader, Hendrik Vermeersch, who organises the workers in the freight and delivery sector (DHL, Fedex, Airport etc). They exchanged a lot of practical experience during this meeting. Hendrik Vermeersch did not limit the discussion to trade union matters but had a lot of questions on the general situation in Venezuela, the role of Cuba etc. Antwerp was the last stop of his visit to Belgium. We started with a visit to the Total oil refinery, where he got a great welcome from the shop stewards belonging to the socialist union in the presence of those of the Christian union, the ACV. To get an idea of the importance of the visit of a Venezuelan trade union leader to Antwerp you need to know that this town hosts the second biggest petrochemical installations in the world, second only to those in Houston Texas. Here again Ruben gave a tireless and passionate account of the resurgence of the workers' movement in his country. He explicitly extended his thanks to Eric Lambert, the convenor of the ABVV in the Total plant who had moved a motion of support of the Bolivarian Revolution and the UNT at the national congress earlier this year. The visit to the refinery left a big impression on Ruben. Then Ruben went to a meeting with the leadership of the union in the Antwerpen Waasland area. This is the biggest branch of the Building, Chemical and Oil Workers' Union, with its 35,000 members and it has become the most important base of support of the trade union solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution. In the evening Ruben spoke at a joint meeting of activists from the two unions. When a clearly happy Ruben left for Venezuela a few hours later he confirmed to me that the first thing he would be doing upon arriving in Caracas was to try and participate in the demonstration of the workers of Sanitarios Maracay who are demanding the nationalisation of their factory.

			Luxemburg gets socialist message on the Venezuelan revolution",2007-02-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," ""If you take into account the current political juncture of the country this was quite a sizeable meeting"" confessed Tun one of the organisers of the first ever conference on the Bolivarian Revolution to take place in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, a fiscal and financial paradise stuck between the Belgian, German and French borders. Some 50 people turned up last Tuesday in the â€˜Casino Syndical', the headquarters of the rail and transport workers' union. The event was organised by two left groups, ""Goosch.lu"" and ""Queesch"" whom we wish to thank again for this initiative. Goosch.lu is the only left electronic weekly in the Duchy of the ""dÃ©i LÃ©nk - la Gauche"", a political movement, left of the social democracy. ""Queesch"", which means something like ""the wrong way"", is the paper of a group of leftwing ""alternative"" youth. Present also were two members of the embassy of Venezuela. Exceptionally, and for the sake of the speaker, the meeting was held in French and not in â€˜LÃ«tzebuerger', the national language of Germanic origin. Erik Demeester from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Belgium gave a socialist analysis of the unfolding revolution in Latin America and Venezuela. The many questions following the lead-off were an indication of the great interest raised amongst the participants who were mainly left wing activists of the trade union movement, some young people and Latin American workers. The subjects discussed ranged from the role of religion and the Catholic Church, to the question of dual power, how to dismantle the bourgeois state, freedom of the press, nationalisations, the fall of the statue of Columbus in Caracas, anti-imperialism, â€˜caudillismo' and ""socialism of the 21st century"". These were undoubtedly subjects that rarely have been so openly discussed in the premises of a trade union in Luxemburg. There is no better measure of the success of this activity than the decision at the end of the meeting - late at night - to establish a solidarity group with the Bolivarian Revolution in Luxemburg. â€˜Hands off Venezuela' promised them all the necessary assistance in this work.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," We welcome the recent decisions of Venezuelan president Hugo ChÃ¡vez to ask for an Enabling Law that will allow for the renationalisation of all privatised companies. This represents a reversal of the economic policies followed by most governments around the world. We would also like to express our support for the struggle of the workers at the Sanitarios Maracay ceramics factory in Aragua, who have run the factory under workers' control since November last year. We add our signatures to their appeal, and we ask from President ChÃ¡vez: nationalise Sanitarios Maracay under workers' control! Those who sign this petition express our support for the workers of Sanitarios Maracay who, faced with the counter-revolutionary and saboteur behaviour of the employer, the coup plotter Alvaro Pocaterra (who abandoned the factory in an attempt to break the will of the workers' by hunger and desperation), have taken over the instalations and have made them run under workers control, including the sale of bathroom components directly to the communities. Faced with this situation we ask from the Bolivarian Government, from the members of the National Assembly and those public institutions involved to fully support this struggle, to declare the company to be of public interest and to proceed to its expropriation and nationalisation under the control of the workers.

			120 people gather in London for Hands Off Venezuela Delegation Report-Back",2007-02-09T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Hands Off Venezuela sent an international delegation to Caracas in December to witness the presidential elections. They were present at Venezuela's biggest ever demonstration. They visited missions, community radio stations, co-ops and factories occupied under workers' control, and were there with thousands of others to hear Chavez's victory speech from the presidential palace. Over 120 people gathered at the Bolivar Hall in the Venezuelan Embassy in Grafton Street, London, this Tuesday to hear the delegation's report. As well as the delegation, speakers included left-wing contender for Labour Party leadership John McDonnell MP, Diane Raby, author of Democracy and Revolution: Latin America and Socialism Today and Alan Woods, author of The Venezuelan Revolution - A Marxist Perspective . John McDonnell kicked off proceedings by publicly congratulating the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign and Alan Woods, its founder, for all the excellent work they have done in focusing attention on the events in Venezuela at a time when it has been so difficult to get information from the mainstream media. He also talked about the need for a society run along socialist principles and the need to bring the revolution to the UK. Interestingly, he made a public offer to Hands Off Venezuela to organise a one day gathering inside the Parliament, which was gladly accepted of course. Alfredo Toro Hardy, the Venezuelan Ambassador in London, then addressed the meeting and thanked Hands Off Venezuela for being the first solidarity campaign to understand the events in Venezuela and to have been the first to initiate solidarity work. He stressed the need to step up the campaign to counter the media lies, referring to the international media depicting Venezuela as heading towards a dictatorship, which has no basis whatsoever in truth. Diane Raby visited Venezuela at the same time as the delegation as an international observer. Referring to the elections she spoke of ""the impressive rigour with which the process was conducted"" citing the Identity Mission set up by the government to ensure ordinary people's official recognition and inclusion on the electoral register. Next Espe Espigares, who chaired the meeting, introduced the report of the delegation of which she was also a part. She described the revolutionary process as ""something really, really contagious and one that penetrates all aspects of Venezuelan society"". Talking about the mood on the streets of Caracas she added ""when we asked what people wanted from Hands Off Venezuela they would speak to us for hours. Such was the enthusiasm for the revolution!"" Matt Stevenson, one of the HoV delegates who went to Venezuela during the elections, next presented a slide-show of photos taken during the visit. They captured the colour and contrasts of a Venezuelan society brought to life through the enthusiasm for revolution. Matt went on to comment about the visit, recalling political discussion spontaneously sparking up on the Caracas metro between pro and anti-Chavistas which he said in contrast showed up the ""marked difference to the level of consciousness we have in this country. You could really feel the process was alive"". The developing consciousness was further highlighted by a phenomenon Matt mentioned, which is known in Venezuela as Rojo Rojito, that is â€˜really red'. This was in regard to the debate going on within the left wing in Venezuela between those who think the revolution has gone far enough, the bureaucracy, and those who want to push the revolution forward, those who are labelled â€˜really red'. Afterwards the first of a short series of films was shown covering the delegation's visit, followed by Mel MacDonald describing the terrible poverty that characterises cities like Caracas. She explained that 85% of the Caracas population live in the notorious Barrios, the city being in a valley where the higher you go up, the poorer it gets. Then Will Roche, another delegate, talked about the examples of workers' control the delegation witnessed, the fact that 30,000 workers were in co-ops in Venezuela and that 1,200 businesses were run under some form of workers' control. Today twenty of those businesses had been nationalised under workers' control. When the delegation visited Sanitarios Maracay it had been occupied for just one month. The workers had seen the need to occupy the factory after it had been abandoned by the owner, who fled after a campaign by the workers for better conditions. This left 800 families without wages. The rising level of consciousness among the workers and throughout the local community was evident, Will said, by the widespread recognition that this was not only about jobs for the here and now, but for future jobs in the community. It was also evident that the Sanitarios Maracay workers had learnt something from past examples, such as the 50-50 division of Invepal between co-operative administration and workers' control. Will explained that where the co-op was involved the company still based itself on the need for profit, leading to the peculiar situation of the workers exploiting themselves, or hiring other workers at a lower wage. What was truly amazing, however, was the international awareness of the workers, which Sean Mackenzie also referred to, describing the Venezuelans' instant identification with his â€˜Make War Not Tea' banner with a picture mocking Tony Blair. Will talked of what seemed to him a touching example of class solidarity, of the workers' understanding of the world-wide interconnection of capital. ""They recognised the need to spread the revolution beyond Venezuela, through Latin America and throughout the world"", he said. Sean continued the point by linking the international and home situation in Britain when he talked of the PCS strike last week and the upcoming RMT and tube cleaners' strikes. ""These are the struggles going on here, under our noses"", he said. Alan Woods, who concluded the speakers, opened by saying, ""The most astonishing thing about all this is that none of this was meant to happen"". His remark was in reference to the ideological offensive against socialism that has been mounted by the bourgeoisie and their lackeys over the past 20 years. Alan went on to criticise the conspiracy of silence that was prevalent in the Western media when such horrors as the Caracazo massacre of 1989 occurred in Venezuela. He emphasised how thousands were killed on that fateful day, when the ""democratic"" government of the day ordered its troops to fire on ordinary working people, men, women and children. There was not a whisper from the mainstream media. The same happened with the right-wing coup of 2002, when they presented it in a positive light. Further to that he pointed to the hypocrisy of the big-business media who now have no choice but to comment on the developments taking place in Venezuela. They cannot ignore it but what they do is to blatantly misrepresent the entire process. ""When the people speak out in such unambiguous terms nobody has the right to question the democratic credentials of Hugo Chavez"", he said. ""It is the duty of every socialist, student, trade unionist, even democrat (whether or not you are a socialist) to defend the democratic process taking place"", Alan said, who posed the question as to whether we in Britain could do with the kind of renationalisation raised by Chavez in January. This was met with an enthusiastic round of applause. Alan concluded by addressing the complaint often levelled at young people in Britain, that they are apathetic when it comes to politics, and contrasted this with the obvious youthful character of the meeting. Offer the people a real alternative, like that in Venezuela, and people will respond was his answer. ""The revolution will not be finished until the oligarchy is defeated...fight for Hands Off Venezuela and above all fight for socialism on a world scale"". After this the floor was opened to questions and contributions. Many questions and points were raised from the floor. One person asked why Chavez needed an Enabling Act to give him powers to rule by decree if he had such popular support? Another question stemmed from a point Will Roche had made earlier, that ""if workers can run factories, they can run society."" The question was asked as to how this might happen. Someone else asked whether the ALBA could be viewed potentially as the first socialist economic bloc in the post-soviet era? And again, someone else asked whether the rule of decree was a sign of strength or weakness? Some of the questions were answered by others intervening in the debate. One comrade, speaking from the audience, pointed out that we must not view the question of the Enabling Act from the comfort of a London flat. The people of Venezuela have waited long enough. They can wait no longer. They are in a hurry and no more time must be wasted. The longer the revolution is delayed the greater the risks of a right-wing backlash. Rather than complaining about Chavez being in a hurry, we should understand that it is the working class, the poor, who are in a hurry. One or two individuals complained that there had not been any ""talk of the class struggle"". This was an amazing statement when we consider that one of the videos shown was of the Sanitarios Maracay workers who had occupied their factory. We could hear workers talking about socialism, revolution, nationalisation under workers' control and so on. It was a living example of the class struggle. Presumably some people can only recognise a revolution if the barricades are up at 9am on Monday morning, with Soviets and so on. The meeting ran late and not all the questions could be answered, although the points did stimulate debate that ran over into the local pub after the meeting. Alan Woods in essence answered many of the points put forward by quoting from Lenin: He explained that what we have in Venezuela is a revolution that is unfolding before our very eyes. He rounded up the meeting by restating: ""It is necessary for us to defend the Bolivarian revolution, for if that revolution is defeated - just imagine the effects. How long will Cuba last? This is the fundamental question that affects socialists everywhere. The importance of Venezuela is beyond solidarity, we must begin a discussion on Venezuela and socialism internationally"". ",NA,NA

			URGENT ACTION: Freedom for Fredy Muñoz, correspondent in Colombia for CANAL TELESUR",2006-12-15T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," URGENT ACTION: For the Freedom of Press... On the evening of November 19, 2006, the journalist FREDY MUÑOZ ALTAMIRANDA, correspondent in Colombia for Canal TELESUR, was detained by agents from the Administrative Department of Security (DAS), when he returned to Colombia after having participated in a TELESUR audiovisual narrative workshop that took place in the neighboring country of Venezuela. By order of the Fifth District Attorney's Office in Barranquilla, FREDY was detained and charged with rebellion. FREDY MUÑOZ has worked in journalism for the last twelve years. He was an editor for the newspapers El Universal and El Periódico, and was a reporter for the television news program 6:25 (all based in Cartagena). He has also produced multiple documentaries for the Trópicos series and TeleCaribe, and audiovisual programming for the Leyendas series by Señal Colombia. Throughout his career, he has excelled for his independence and, as he stated in a public communiqué issued from where he is being detained, ""for proclaiming the truth; and, in our aggrieved Latin American countries, truth is the sun that reveals and removes men from the shadows."" In the voice of the journalist Fredy Muñoz, the work performed by Telesur excels at disseminating the social dynamics and struggles laying claim to social and political rights in the Colombia. Throughout Latin America, TELESUR has consolidated as an alternative communication proposal in opposition to the hegemony of the mass media protecting the interests of the powerful economic groups and, in light of the so-called fight against terrorism, legitimizing the persecution of social movements. The detention of this journalist is a clear illustration of the restrictions to the freedom of press in Colombia. This detention also bears further witness to the persecution subjected upon the voices critical of the current presidential administration and its policy of democratic security. On these grounds, we request that the relevant authorities: 1. Respect the life and physical and psychological integrity of the journalist; 2. Respect due process and the right to defense (and in this respect transfer the case to the city of Bogotá); 3. Respect the free exercise of the freedom of expression.

			 Pakistan: Victory Of Chavez - Dawn of Socialism of the 21st century",2006-12-10T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Adam Pal"," The Hands off Venezuela Campaign held meetings across Pakistan to celebrate the victory of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in the recent elections and to show appreciation for the steps taken by him to eradicate unemployment, illiteracy and the other evils of this dying capitalist system. Meetings were held in Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, Raheem Yar Khan and Attock while and more meetings are to be held in Quetta on December 12 and in Karachi on December 13. A public meeting of youth and workers was held at the Kisan Hall on December 10 to celebrate the landslide victory of Chavez. The main guest at the occasion was the renowned revolutionary, Dr. Lal Khan, while other speakers included Zohaib Butt, President of Berozgar Nojwan Tehreek (BNT - the Unemployed Youth Movement), Naeem Khan, from the Jammu Kashmir National Students' Federation (JKNSF Lahore Branch) and Adam Pal for Youth For International Socialism (YFIS). All the speakers hailed the workers and youth of Venezuela who have achieved a remarkable victory in taking the revolution another step forward. They expressed their support for the Bolivarian revolution and its achievements. They also emphasized the need for a revolution in Pakistan and said that they see the revolution of Venezuela as the torch bearer of all revolutions of the 21 st century. The speakers explained that the gathering in Lahore showed clearly just how fast revolutions and its messages are spreading throughout the world. If capitalism is overthrown completely in Venezuela then it will inspire the workers and youth all over the world to overcome their miseries and sufferings and overthrow this poisonous system. In the end Dr. Lal Khan spoke for more than one hour and gave a detailed analysis of the situation in Venezuela and Latin America. He explained the dialectics process taking place in Latin America with the victory of left-wing leaders in many countries. He also explained that now a qualitative change is needed in the Bolivarian revolution itself to overthrow the fetters of capitalism and abolish the old property relations. He said that the role of Chavez as an individual in history is significant, as he signifies not only the aspirations of millions of poor people in Venezuela but around the whole world. Today, in a country as far away as Pakistan people know him and admire him for his left-wing policies. The victory of Chavez, he said, would be a new turn in the history of Latin America and now the Bolivarian revolution has entered a decisive phase. Revolutionary songs were also sung at the end of the meeting, which were received enthusiastically. A meeting was held at the Al Shams Hotel to celebrate Chavez's election victory. Comrade Irshad chaired the meeting while Comrade Manzoor Ahmed was main guest. The inaugural address was given by Comrade Manzoor Ahmed. Congratulating the victory of Chavez he said that his victory is the victory of the workers of Venezuela and of the whole world and that is was a defeat for the ""Devil"". The repercussions of this victory will reverberate throughout the whole world and the workers of Pakistan must be prepared. He gave a brief history of the political career of Chavez and how he was transformed when he was made president of Venezuela in 1998. His move towards socialism was inevitable and through his experience of capitalist democracy he reached the conclusion that socialism was the only solution for the miseries of millions of people. He commended him for giving free education and health care serviced in Venezuela. He also praised the policy of nationalization of industry and told the audience how after nationalization the workers control their companies. He also gave a detailed account of the expansion of the revolution to other Latin American countries and how the candidates supported by Chavez are winning presidential elections. In the end he said that this victory was a ray of hope for the workers of the whole world and will inspire more revolutionary movements all over the world. Participants in the meeting included Comrade Kabir Khan from the PTUDC, Comrade Changaiz, BNT organizer in Attock, Tauqeer Abbas from the PSF, Raja Guftar of the PSF, Amjad Rasheed of the JKNSF, Zahid Iqbal from the JKNSF (Pindi branch) and Huma Zain, BNT organizer in Wah. There was a large number of students, youth and workers who also participated. A ceremony was held to celebrate the victory of Chavez and as well as to launch the Urdu translation of The Venezuelan Revolution: a Marxist Perspective by Alan Woods. The meeting was chaired by Qamar Uz Aman Khan and the main guest was Comrade Hina Zain. The main speakers were Mahmood Ul Hassan from Rahim Yar Khan, Mukhtar Gul Shah from Sadikabad, Molana Maqsood from Rahim Yar Khan, Dr Yasir Irshad from Bahawalpur, Saeed Nasir from Dahrki. There were more than 120 people present at the meeting. The main participants were Mr Zahid Kanju, President of Bazm-e-Farid, Rana Habibullah, Vice President of the PPPP, Rahim Yar Khan, Sher Channa, Opposition leader in the Assembly of Rahim Yar, Molana Rauf Rabbani, Labour member of the district assembly, Rana Nadeem, General Secretary of PPPP, Dr Abulhassan, and Jam Saleem Tanwari. A meeting was held at the Multan Law College which was chaired by Comrade Zeeshan and Yusaf Raza Gillani, Vice Chairman of the PPP. A large number of students from universities and colleges attended the meeting. Speakers included PPP leader from Multan, Comrade Ilyas Khan, Nadeem Pasha, Dr.Ahmed Arsalan and Anam Patafi. All the participants praised the victory of Chavez and emphasized the need for a revolution in Pakistan. In the end Yusuf Raza Gillani said that socialist revolution was the only solution for the problems in Pakistan and that the workers of Pakistan should be inspired by the example set by their brothers and sisters in Venezuela.

													Andy Higginbottom - Colombia Solidarity Campaign"," Members of Hands Off Venezuela and War on Want joined Colombia Solidarity Campaign on its emergency protest outside the Colombian Embassy in luxurious Knightsbridge, London on 21 December. Picketers demanded the release of Telesur journalist Freddy Muñoz detained by Colombian authorities since 19 November , and handed in a letter of protest demanding that Vice-President Santos withdraws his comments targeting food and drinks workers union SINALTRAINAL. On 12 December Santos attacked the union's fight for justice from notorious multinationals Coca Cola, Nestlé and other private corporations, and contended that they are pushed by ""sectors of the extreme left, radicals infiltrated into trade union sectors that are generating absolutely absurd campaigns against the corporations"". In Colombia this is a green light for paramilitary attack and, following Santos prompt, two days later the ‘Black Eagles' left a death threat inside the home of Barranquilla SINALTRAINAL activist EURIPIDES YANCE, also targeting his fellow Coca-Cola workers LIMBERTO CARRANZA, CAMPO QUINTERO and several local trade union, student and social movement leaders, as well as defenders of human rights. The Black Eagles gave their targets one week to leave, or else. Colombia Solidarity calls on Santos, who is formally responsible for human rights within the government, to withdraw his prejudicial comments against SINALTRAINAL, do everything possible to ensure the life and safety of the people targeted in the Black Eagles death threat, and there families and to instigate a thorough criminal investigation into the intellectual and material authors of the death threat. Christmas and New Year is a notoriously dangerous time for Colombian trade unionists, a killing season when paramilitaries are let off the leash\nfree of international scrutiny. It is therefore particularly important that protests continue worldwide. Further actions are planned in Bristol, Barcelona and Sydney.

			 Day of solidarity with Venezuela in Belgium",2006-12-23T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV Belgium"," Until a few years ago, Venezuela was a blind spot on the world map for most left activists. Today, it has become the point of reference in the struggle for a better society. On December 9, 350 people gathered in Brussels to learn more about the Bolivarian Revolution. This day of solidarity took place at the headquarters of the Christian union ACV/CSC in Brussels. Guy Tordeur, secretary of the Christian union ACV Brussel-Halle-Vilvoorde, stated that in Belgium too, the working class falls victim to neo-liberalism, and that the recent events at the Volkswagen factory in Vorst are a clear example of this. For this reason, Tordeur is very happy with Chavez's victory, because Chavez ""is trying to build a genuine alternative"". He was also delighted to be able to introduce Ruben Linares, a speaker from the Venezuelan trade union, the UNT. Now that the new trade union has seen the light of day, Tordeur stressed that there is an opportunity for the ACV to urge for the official recognition of the UNT as the real trade union in Venezuela. Next up, Katia Nouten of Oxfam Solidarity, introduced the four guest speakers at the plenary session: the American sociologist Gregory Wilpert of www.venezuelanalysis.com , the Venezuelan ambassador in Belgium, Alejandro Fleming, Ruben Linares of the UNT, and Frans Wuytack, a Belgian priest who actively took part in the struggles in the working class districts of Caracas. Gregory Wilpert started by saying that never before has a Venezuelan president been elected by such a large margin. He continued by summing up the many achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution in laying out the vision of ""Socialism of the 21 st Century"", which is a core discussion in Venezuela today. He stressed that Venezuela is already transcending capitalism, for four reasons: 1) Venezuela has no need for foreign investment, 2) Venezuela doesn't tag along behind the old elite, 3) the Venezuelan government is centred around participatory democracy, and 4) there is a clear move towards "" cogestión "" (co-management) and co-operatives. One million Venezuelans are already working in co-operative structures. There are still various obstacles that lie ahead on the road to socialism; the external obstacles, as Wilpert calls them, like imperialism, the opposition on the world market, are quickly losing ground and have diminished in influence. The main - internal - obstacles are nepotism and corruption within the state apparatus and the dependency of the Bolivarian movement upon one sole person, i.e. Chavez. So the challenge today is to structurally consolidate the revolution at a grassroots level. Ambassador Alejandro Fleming mainly spoke about the revolutionary process. Chavez himself has filled the ideological void which existed before. But the old state apparatus is corrupt, so that even today, people cannot make full use of it. Yet, this is changing as well. The people themselves are the engine of this process. That is why the government dedicates so much effort to education. A people that is kept in a state of backwardness, will always be prone to manipulation by a populist leader. In saying this, Fleming threw one of the main points of criticism of the opposition - i.e. that of Chavez being a populist - back in their face. Fleming also defended the Venezuelan government's international measures, that were ill received by the press. ""We stepped out of the Andes Community because it defends the interests of the rich."" The Venezuelan government's priorities clearly lie elsewhere. Trade union leader Ruben Linares started his speech by describing an excursion he made in Belgium. Upon arrival, Erik Demeester (Vonk Hands Off Venezuela Belgium) had guided him to a picket at the Volkswagen assembly factory and concluded: ""VW is the kind of answer that capitalism gives to the people, i.e. exploitation and looting."" After that, he explained how the Bolivarian revolution had grown out of a spontaneous uprising. In 1989, the people thought: ""This country is rich with oil, and yet we are hungry."" That is why they took to the streets, but the government brutally suppressed it. 4,000 people lost their lives. The new movement around Hugo Chavez was the people's response. Today, every Venezuelan has a weapon to fight back, and Ruben took out his weapon to prove this: the Bolivarian constitution. When the rich or the state try to violate their rights, the people quote from the constitution. On December 3, 63 percent of the population voted for socialism. For many it isn't entirely clear what this means yet, but most of the people already see the clear difference with their earlier lives, and have come to the conclusion that socialism is something good. Linares ended his flaming speech with Che Guevara's infamous words: ""Socialism or death"", which was welcomed by the most thunderous applause that day. Before Frans Wuytack started his speech, the participants of the meeting watched a promotional trailer for a documentary about his life, made by his son Fabio, who reconstructed his father's life and work in the working class districts of Caracas, and linked this up with today's events. ""I am not an expert on Latin American economics or politics,"" Frans Wuytack stated, ""but I am here today to give testimony to the courage of the Venezuelan people!"" He pleaded that the people not submit themselves to the bourgeoisie. ""Have we become the altar boys of capital?"" said the former priest. He referred to Chavez's speech to the United Nations, and to the Belgian prime minister Verhofstadt who kisses the hand of Bush. Frans spoke about his experiences in Venezuela during the 1960s, about the struggle for better living conditions in the working class regions. It was a time when thousands of people marched to the city centre to demand drinkable water. The police asked: ""Do you have an authorisation to demonstrate?"" And there reply was: ""No, we don't... but we are thirsty!"" At the time, the people were not able to win their demands. This changed when a woman walked down from the hills carrying her dead child in her arms and followed by her other children. She walked many kilometres and refused to move until she spoke to the person in charge. Thousands of people came to support her and soon the pressure was too heavy to resist and the authorities had to bow. One woman had started this. From this experience Frans concluded that the struggle is worth it, every day, again and again. After the speeches, time was given for questions from the floor. From most of these questions, it was clear that the participants wanted to learn more about the Bolivarian Revolution, and also that the process in Venezuela generated a lot of enthusiasm. One woman asked - she almost begged - how we could transplant this experience to Belgium? Partly due to the lack of time there was no time for contributions from the floor, only questions. This is a pity because debating and exchanging ideas corresponds to the living spirit of the Bolivarian revolution and by extension to every revolution. Ruben Linares was a living witness to the importance of ideas in the revolution and the importance of reading. He referred to Chavez's own way in stimulating reading and debating. On television he tells for instance: ""I'm not Trotskyite but I read Trotsky, I'm not a Marxist but I read Marx. And I read Rosa Luxemburg etc."" Ruben Linares also referred to the debate Chavez has started about the need for one party regrouping all the revolutionary forces (something completely different is told by the bourgeois media who present his proposal as a way to establish a one party state). The trade unionist explained that this proposal stimulated the debate in the Bolivarian movement about the kind of party that was needed to take the revolution forward. ""But the landless peasants say that they don't want to be in one party together with the big landowners who oppress them and the workers don't want one party with the bosses"". These debates sharpen the ideological understanding of the tactics and the forces needed to advance the revolution. This plenary session was followed by two workshops and the screening of different documentaries. One workshop dealt with the role of the media in informing the world about Venezuela. Ronnie Ramirez, Maurice Lemoine and Michel Collon explained the role of the media in the Bolivarian revolution and the lies of the media against the process. Ruben Linares was the central speaker in the workshop on trade unions. Ruben sketched the birth of the UNT and the debates going on in the revolutionary union. Bruno Verlaeckt from the Socialist Union in Antwerp, which organises the building workers, petrochemical plants, etc. as well as Omer Mommaerts from the Christian Union of Brussels stressed the importance of the struggle of the workers movement in Belgium. At the end of the meeting a debate was held which was led by Erik Demeester and different speakers shed light on various aspects of the Bolivarian revolution. Socialist Party senator Sfia Bouarfa, an international observer of the Venezuelan elections, certified that the elections were very democratic. Her Green colleague, Josy Dubié, confirmed this but added that in Venezuela the good slogans of the anti-globalistation movement - to give back the wealth of the country to the people- was becoming reality. Paul-Emile dealt with the relationship between Venezuela and the European Union. He reminded us that the EU had approved the military coup in 2002 against Chavez. During the recent debate in the United Nations on the membership of Venezuela on the Security Council all European countries (with the exception of Italy who abstained) followed the position of the United States. The program of the EU for Latin America is to create a free trade zone, something different from ALBA, which should serve as an example of the way forward. Marcelo Estrada from Bolivia explained how his country was developing relations with Venezuela and Cuba within ALBA. He concluded by saying that a new era has been opened up for the peoples of Latin America. A representative of the Cuban embassy formulated an important idea shared by all the organisations that participated in the meeting. ""Even if we sometimes have different ideas, what brings us together is the support for the political process in Venezuela"". At the end the four speakers from the opening meeting intervened. Ruben Linares, the last speaker of the day, concluded with the cry, ""Socialism or death!"" A thunderous standing ovation and the singing of revolutionary slogans marked the end of the day. Undoubtedly this day of solidarity represents a serious step forward for the movement in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. Hands Off Venezuela is now proposing to continue organising meetings and solidarity based on the example of the successes in Antwerp and Brussels and to extend the message of the Bolivarian revolution to other cities in Belgium.

													Hands Off Venezuela Arabic"," In the last fifteen years US imperialism and its allies have dominated the international scene smashing with their iron heel every single country or people who have stood in their way. The aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq, the constant support granted to the Israeli regional power in its war against the Palestinian people and the aggression against Lebanon, the attempted 2002 coup against president Chavez in Venezuela... these are only the main manifestations of the imperialist policies carried out by the US government and its allies against the peoples of the whole world. The other powers have been watching the US bullying the rest of the world and their only concern has been to ensure for themselves the highest share of the profits. The promise of a ""New world order"", of peace and international cooperation has turned into a nightmare for billions of people and imperialist rule has shown its real face of utter reaction. The ""War on terror"" is in reality a war for domination and exploitation. The aim of this war is to reaffirm US rule over the rest of the world. Through international treaties and world institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the main world powers have managed to force most of the weaker countries to follow the line of privatisations, cuts in social spending and a general selling off of all natural resources and profitable businesses to foreign capital. These policies have caused a social disaster in one country after another, but huge profits in the pockets of the multinational corporations and of their local servants. But the greedy quest for more and more profits on the part of the imperialist powers has also provoked deep changes in the minds and hearts of millions of people. This has led to consequences the imperialists could not foresee. The downtrodden workers and peasants, the peoples of the world are raising their heads once again. This process started in Latin America with the 1998 victory of Hugo Chavez in the Venezuelan presidential elections, the 2000 uprising in Ecuador, the Argentinean insurrection of December 2001, the Bolivian 2003 and 2005 insurrectionary movements that finally ended in the outstanding victory in the presidential elections of the peasant leader Evo Morales one year ago. This powerful movement of the Latin American masses for change was expressed also in the Lula victory in the 2002 Brazilian presidential elections and the victory of the ""Frente Amplio"" in Uruguay, as well as in important social movements in Peru and Chile. Last, but not less important, has been the magnificent movement of the Mexican masses that erupted this summer in support of the left-wing candidate Lopez Obrador and against blatant electoral fraud organised by Mexican ruling class and US imperialism. The winds of revolution are blowing in the US's very backyard and are affecting all the countries including the USA themselves, where the biggest movement since the 1930's erupted this year as a reaction of millions of Latin American migrant workers against the inhuman immigration law the government wanted to introduce. Everywhere the masses are struggling and moving forward, learning from their own experiences, striving to find a way out of misery and oppression. The Venezuelan revolution is at the forefront of this battle and is playing a key role in raising the hopes, the confidence and expectations of the exploited masses everywhere, including Europe and the USA. In spite of the worldwide campaign of slanders and distortions that has been waged against Chavez, Venezuela is showing that another world is possible, that it is possible to challenge the economic and military power of the USA, but it also shows that a revolutionary movement of the mass of the population can change the balance of forces in society and prepare for a decisive change as long as it puts forward an alternative to capitalist exploitation. Hugo Chavez tried for some years to get a fair deal from the imperialists and the Venezuelan oligarchy, but at the same time, unlike many other ""leftists"" once they get to the government, he was not prepared to betray the expectations of the masses of the population that lived below the poverty line. He sought a way of carrying out the reforms that were needed to get the mass of the population out of poverty but at the same time to maintain capitalism, but with ""a human face"". This has proven to be impossible. The oligarchy and the imperialists could not allow any country to be an exception to the general rule, especially Venezuela, which is the fifth oil producer in the world. Chavez declared in January 2005 that experience has shown that there was no third way possible. It is either capitalism or socialism. Capitalism is bankrupt; all that this system can provide is oppression, poverty and wars. Therefore he raised the socialist perspective for Venezuela, ""socialism of the XXI century"", based on revolutionary democracy and participation. This turn was greeted with a wave of popular enthusiasm. Imperialism and the Venezuelan oligarchy have tried to block the revolution with all their power. At first they were confident they would be able to corrupt Chavez, but when they realized they could not achieve this, they organised a coup d'etat on 11 April 2002 leaning on the high command of the army, the corrupt leadership of the CTV (the yellow trade union), Fedecamaras (the bosses' confederation), the Catholic Church hierarchy, all the major mass media outlets and of course the CIA that pulled all the strings. Every reactionary section of Venezuelan society supported the coup. Chavez was kidnapped from the presidential palace and a new government was set up. On the morning of April 12 the coup apparently had won. Many supporters and leaders of the Bolivarian movement went into hiding or were being arrested. As the reactionaries were gaining confidence they started to move towards more and more repression. But what happened immediately afterwards has changed the whole position. From the poorest neighbourhoods and shanty towns hundreds of thousands of workers and youth took to the streets, in spite of the curfew imposed by the army. The soldiers were not prepared to fight against their own people. Over a million people besieged the presidential palace and gave the decisive push to the majority of the soldiers and officers who wanted to defend the legitimate government but had been betrayed by their high command. The coup collapsed in less than 36 hours showing the real power of a revolutionary people in struggle. Again the counterrevolution hit back hard with a bosses' lockout which paralysed most of the private sector and the state oil company, PDVSA, from December 2002 to January 2003. The world press reported that a general strike against a ""dictator"" was taking place in Venezuela. Once again, this reactionary move was defeated by the workers who managed to take over the factories and reopen most of the economic activities and to restart under workers' management oil production which accounts for 80% of total Venezuelan exports. In August 2004 the reactionary Venezuelan opposition was massively defeated in the recall referendum against president Chavez that they had campaigned for. Ironically, this right of recall was granted under the Bolivarian Constitution brought in by Chavez himself, the most democratic and advanced constitution in the world, hated by the very reactionary oligarchs who were now using it. Once again the mass mobilization succeeded in blocking this new reactionary manoeuvre. During the last eight years Chavez has won 11 different elections, but still most of the world media portrays him as a dictator. What strikes anyone who has had the opportunity to visit Venezuela is the widespread popular participation and the most complete freedom to express different ideas within the Bolivarian movement. Hundreds of Bolivarian organisations participate in a continuous mass debate that constantly develops around any important issue. This barefaced lying on the part of the international media shows simply to what degree the world's mass media industry is corrupt and in the pay of imperialism. Why is the vast majority of the Venezuelan population so willing to defend the Bolivarian revolution and Chavez? The answer is simple: to defend what has been achieved by the revolution during these years. The ""Misiones"" have managed to tackle some of the more endemic problems of Venezuelan society such as illiteracy. It is thanks to the Mission ""Robinson"" that Venezuela has been declared free from illiteracy by UNESCO. They have allowed access to further education for most of the youth who were excluded from high school and university studies. Social programmes to develop the living conditions in the poor communities have gone some way to alleviating poverty. The Mission ""Barrio Adentro"" has provided essential medical care for the whole of Venezuelan society. Thanks to the work of 20,000 Cuban doctors and nurses, millions of people now have access to medical care for the first time in their life. Laws that protected the communities against multinational plundering of natural resources have been passed. The struggle for the implementation of the Agrarian Reform has been backed by the government and this has led to the first wave of expropriations of latifundia in the last few years. A strong peasant and land workers' movement is pushing for a general expropriation of big landed property. Venezuela is a country where the majority of the land is left uncultivated and 70% to 80% of the total food needs are imported. This struggle is facing the fierce reaction of the landowners who finance paramilitary bands of thugs. More than 150 peasant leaders have been killed in the last few years. Chavez has managed to break the US economic blockade that was strangling Cuba, providing energy and oil in exchange for the services of doctors and teachers and he is also supporting the Bolivian government's stand for the nationalization of gas and oil resources. He has offered cheap fuel for the heating of poor communities in the USA and Europe and has appealed to the US workers to struggle against imperialism. All this and a number of other major reforms have been possible only because Chavez was able to gain real control of Venezuela's most important resource, the oil reserves. For the first time in Venezuelan history the revenue produced by the oil industry has been massively used to finance the government's social spending, instead of enriching the oligarchy. These are some of the reasons why the Venezuelan workers, peasants and youth are determined to fight till the end to defend their revolution. The struggle for workers control and management is rising everywhere. During the reactionary bosses' lockout the workers answered by taking over some of the key economic activities of the country and managed in a few weeks to restore the activities of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company which is at the core of the Venezuelan economy. The prompt reaction on the part of the workers doomed the lockout to failure and saved the revolution from a very dangerous position. After the defeat of the lockout there was a wave of factory closures. Hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs. The workers waged long struggles in a number of workplaces against sell-offs and closures, which finally culminated in the first victory when President Chavez finally decreed the nationalisation of Venepal (later known as Invepal), an important paper mill, in January 2005. This was followed by the victory of the workers of CNV (later known as Inveval), who won a hard-fought battle in May 2005 when their factory was nationalised under workers' control and management. In June 2005, President Chavez presented a list of 800 companies that had been closed. He also presented a list of a further 1147 factories and companies that were not producing at full capacity due to sabotage on the part of the bosses. He invited the workers to take over these firms and to run them, promising that the government would support them. Over the course of the last year a number of other companies have been expropriated and put under different forms of workers' management. A movement for workers' control developed in important state owned companies such as ALCASA, an aluminium smelter, and CADAFE, an electricity company. This movement was faced with resistance from the state bureaucracy and the reformist wing of the Bolivarian movement and failed to spread and become more generalised, as the situation really requires. But this is also teaching some lessons to the workers about the role they should play as an organised force to push forward the revolution. This experience led to the birth of FRETECO, the Revolutionary Front of Workers in Occupied Companies which has the aim of generalising the process of expropriating the oligarchy and taking over the commanding heights of the economy under workers' control and management as a means of give a decisive push in the direction of socialism. Hands Off Venezuela was launched after the 2002 attempted coup, with the aims of supporting the Bolivarian Revolution against imperialist interference. Our first task is to build direct links between the mass working class organisations all over the world and the Bolivarian Revolution, to fight the avalanche of slanders and lies that the CNN and other international media companies are spreading about the real character of the revolutionary movement in Venezuela and in the whole of Latin America. Direct links and direct knowledge of the real processes developing in Latin America are the best antidotes to the poisonous campaign being carried out by the big media. We believe that in all countries the example of the Venezuelan struggle shows a way forward for the revolutionary youth and the workers in their daily struggle for emancipation. It shows that a socialist perspective for the struggle of the peoples of the world is not only possible but is necessary and that this struggle unites all the workers and oppressed peoples against capitalism and imperialist oppression. The Venezuelan revolution demonstrates the power of the working masses once they move and also the limits of imperialist power. The Latin American revolution opens up a perspective for the struggles of the peoples of the whole of the Middle East. If it left isolated, the magnificent struggle of the peoples of the Middle Eastern countries is not enough to defeat imperialist oppression. What is needed is an international perspective. The workers and youth and the all the peoples of Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq are paying a bitter price for imperialist oppression. Sectarianism and ethnic and religious clashes are promoted by imperialist rulers according to the old and well-know method of ""divide and rule"". Who really gains from a war of workers against workers? Sectarianism only plays into the hands of the oppressor. Imperialism can be defeated only through mass revolutionary action and unity. The wealth and natural resources of the Middle East should be used for the benefit of the peoples, not to enrich the few. The Venezuelan Revolution demonstrates that this is not only possible but it is also necessary. Only the corruption of the ruling classes and imperialist oppression prevents this from becoming a reality. A victory in Venezuela would inspire and strengthen the workers struggling in all parts of the world. A defeat would on the contrary strengthen the oppressors. Chavez's recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly was an open denunciation of the crimes of imperialism. The conflict over the choice of the Latin American temporary representative in the Security Council (Venezuela against the US-backed Guatemala) reflects the bitterness of the struggle. The December presidential elections are an important turning point in the development of the Venezuelan Revolution. They reflect the struggle between the Venezuelan workers and peasants and the oligarchy and imperialism. The oligarchy and imperialism are doing everything in their power to bring about the defeat of Chavez. The counterrevolutionary forces have already started a campaign to discredit the elections. They will use all the means at their disposal to undermine them: bribery, corruption, slander and lies and all kinds of sabotage. According to all the surveys, Oppositionist candidate Rosales has no chance of winning with normal means, but it is likely that they will try to use the electoral campaign to plot something that would discredit the outcome of the elections. They will have at their disposal considerable resources: the wealth of the oligarchy, the technology of the CIA, the backing of the US embassy, the yellow press and the rest of the prostituted media. On the other side we have the revolutionary spirit, courage and dedication of millions of Venezuelan workers, peasants and urban poor, the revolutionary youth, the revolutionary sections of the army and the progressive artists and intelligentsia - in short, all the live forces of Venezuelan society, backed by the exploited masses of Latin America and the working class of the entire world. The workers and peasants are fighting to transform society. Great advances have been made, but the final goal has not been reached. The power of the oligarchy has not yet been broken. As long as this is the case, the revolution cannot be irreversible and will be constantly under threat. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela Canada"," WHERE: Outside the Venezuelan Consulate at Bloor and Huntley. WHAT: Hands Off Venezuela rally in solidarity with the Hugo Chavez government. WHEN: Sunday, December 3, 1 pm In one of those rare occasions when activists rally in elation instead of dissent, Venezuelan solidarity activists headed to Bloor Street just hours before front-runner President Hugo Chavez won a landslide victory and a third term in office. Hands Off Venezuela folks want Chavez to continue using oil revenues to fund services for the poor, and hope to build political support so the U.S. and Canada stop trying to undermine his regime. But they aren't the only ones here this evening. As I ask Chavez supporter Alberto Arzola, founder of the Bolivarian Circle Louis Riel , whether ""socialist oil'' could happen in Canada, a woman comes up behind me and whispers in my ear, ""Ask him where he's from.'' Turns out she's a supporter of Chavez's opposition and is referring to the rumour that HOV members are not Venezuelan. Arzola, who's originally from Caracas, ignores her jeers. Indeed, a number of people among the 450 expatriates lined up to vote at the consulate wear blue, the colour of Chavez's electoral enemies. They charge that the president intimidates those who campaign against him, not merely the rich. ""In Canada, there is no strong group for the regime, because [people here] were persecuted out of the country,'' says Venezuelans for Democracy founder Eduardo Harari . HOV members, however, say such talk represents hostility to the regime's social justice moves. ""George Bush and Stephen Harper are afraid of what is happening in Venezuela,'' says HOV's Alex Grant . ""There, working people are taking power in their own hands.'' ",NA,NA

			Hands Off Venezuela Debates Opposition at Toronto Consulate on Election Day",2006-12-04T00:00:00Z,NA," Dec 3rd 2006. On a freezing December day in Toronto, Hands Off Venezuela activists picketed in solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution. At the same time several hundred emigre Venezuelans exercised their right to vote at the Venezuelan Consulate. HOV activists handed out an election statement (see attached PDF) and debated with opposition supporters. One oppositionist was heard saying, ""Oh no. We even have to face the revolution in Canada!"" Unlike in Venezuela, most Venezuelans who live in Canada support the opposition. You have to have money and connections to get a Canadian visa. We even saw a few oppositionists in expensive fur coats as they waited to vote. But the idea of the revolutionary unity of the Americas is even reaching snowy Canada, so these poor bourgeois will have to find a new place to run to! HOV and others in the Venezuela solidarity movement are doing everything possible to keep the US and Canada's Conservative government away from interfering with the right of the Venezuelan people to choose their president. In Vancouver, HOV also organized a very successful victory party on the evening of Dec 3rd. The massive victory of Chavez in the Presidential elections is really a victory for the Venezuelan people, especially the poor and working class. There is also a lesson for workers and left politicians around the world - the Bolivarian Revolution has increased support to over 61% by moving leftwards and not by accommodating a non-existent ""middle."" After the election results were announced Chavez pledged to deepen his effort to transform Venezuela into a socialist society. ""Long live the socialist revolution! Destiny has been written,"" Chavez shouted to thousands of flag-waving supporters wearing red shirts and braving the pouring rain. ""That new era has begun,"" he said, raising a hand in the air. ``We have shown that Venezuela is red! .x .x . No one should fear socialism .x .x . Socialism is human. Socialism is love,"" Chavez said. ""Down with imperialism! We need a new world!"" It is ideas such as these that are spreading the message of the Venezuelan Revolution to workers and youth throughout the hemisphere. On Tuesday 5th, HOV Toronto is supporting a celebration of the election victory together with 4 other Latin American solidarity organizations (details below). The victory of the Venezuelan revolution marks a step forward for the movement inside Venezuela and the solidarity movement around the world.

			Celebrations after Chavez victory at Bolivar Hall in London",2006-12-05T00:00:00Z,NA," Yesterday, Monday, December 5, a group of Hands off Venezuela activists, supporters and friends of the Venezuelan revolution came together at the doors of the Bolivar Hall, in central London, to celebrate the victory of the candidate of the Bolivarian revolution, Hugo Chávez Frías. Hugo Chávez, who, according to the latest CNE bulletin (National Electoral Committee), has won with 62.57% (6,857,485 votes), came out onto the ""People's Balcony"" at the Miraflores Palace, in Caracas, soon after the first results were released and spoke to a crowd of hundreds of thousands of Bolivarians, to whom he said; ""the people have not voted for Chávez, but for a project with a name: Bolivarian socialism"" and stressed that the new phase that the revolution was entering would see the building of a new State on the basis of a ""battle against bureaucratism and corruption"". In London, Hands off Venezuela activists and supporters adorned the Bolivar Hall entrance with banners celebrating this historic victory for the revolution and encouraging the president to decisively move forward and complete the revolution. ""Venezuela Roja, Rojita"", ""With Chavez Forwards!"" or ""Venezuela p'alante with Chavez"" could be read on the banners and people enthusiastically chanted ""uh, ah, Chavez no se va"" or ""Alerta, alerta, que camina la espada de Bolivar por America Latina"". After an hour of chanting, clapping and laughing on the street, the group was invited to come in and celebrate with the Bolivar Hall staff, who welcomed them with rum, champagne and beer. One of the workers at Bolivar Hall made a toast to the health of President Chavez, the Bolivarian revolution and international socialism, to which everybody responded cheerfully by rising their glasses. The mood was great. Everybody was happy, cheerful and delighted with this triumph of the Venezuelan masses in their struggle against the reactionary oligarchy and imperialism. However, people were also aware of the dangers that a vacillating attitude on the part of Chavez in taking the practical measures that would guarantee the completion of the revolution, secure its achievements and lay the basis for their improvement, may bring in the future.

			Vienna: Successful Hands off Venezuela rally at Venezuelan embassy",2006-12-05T00:00:00Z,NA," Yesterday, December 4, about 40 people took part in a rally to express their solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution in front of the Venezuelan embassy in the capital city of Austria, Vienna. A broad alliance of the left, including Hands off Venezuela, the Socialist Youth Vienna, Der Funke, AIK, KI, KSV and KJÖ, had called for the meeting. The initiative for the rally came as the ""Oligarchs Tremble"" campaign was launched in Venezuela, a united front campaign including, amongst others, the revolutionary peasant organisation, Ezequiel Zamora (FNCEZ) and organisations of the labour movement such as FRETECO and the CMR. This campaign was greeted by Hands off Venezuela Austria as a first step to unite all revolutionary organisations in their common struggle against the counter-revolutionary activities of the Venezuelan opposition. A banner carrying the slogan ""Socialism of the 21 st century: Nationalisation under workers' control"" made it clear that the participants not only celebrated the positive outcome of the elections, but also expressed the necessity of deepening the revolution and move forward to socialism. One of the speakers mentioned the struggle of the workers of Sanitarios Maracay, who decided to keep production going under workers' control after the boss of the factory had announced its closure: ""Only the nationalisation under workers' control can be the way forward, to maintain production and save jobs. Through this the factory could become an integral part of Chávez's ""socialism of the 21 st century"". A delegation of participants handed over a resolution of the Hands off Venezuela campaign to the ambassador of Venezuela, Miriam García de Pérez expressing their solidarity with the Bolivarian cause and calling for a deepening of the revolutionary process. The final speech of the rally was made by the ambassador herself. She stressed that the revolutionary changes in Venezuela were only the beginnings of a transformation of society worldwide.

They had organised a lobby in front of the consulate for the same morning, and even had a T-shirt made with the slogan ""No al fraude"". But Rosales' defeat was so clear that they didn't dare to show up and they cancelled their lobby. We made a proposal to the opposition supporters that they sell us their t-shirts at a discounted price, so we could send them to Mexico... but so far we have not received any reply. We turned the rally into a celebration of Chavez's victory. We produced a leaflet, available at http://www.marxismo.net/amlat/Elezionidicembre.pdf and we were pleased to see that a good number of people passing by were aware of the Venezuelan elections and they sympathised with Chavez.

			HOV meetings in Paris: Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution",2006-12-03T00:00:00Z,NA," More than 50 people gathered in Paris on Thursday, November 30 at a meeting called by the French Marxist Tendency La Riposte to discuss the revolutionary process in Latin America. The main speaker was Jorge Martin who dealt mainly with the revolutionary processes going on in Venezuela and Mexico. Jorge spent quite a lot of time on the Venezuelan presidential elections of this coming Sunday, December 3. He explained how these are not just normal presidential elections, as the opposition is certain that they cannot win. The main thing is to see what the opposition, that is, the oligarchy and imperialism will do faced with defeat. It is clear that they have prepared a plan of destabilisation centred around the claim that the election results will be fraudulent. Jorge insisted on the need to be vigilant and to mobilise our forces on Sunday and Monday to defeat any attempts of the counter-revolution. But he added that after defeating the oligarchy on December 3rd, the revolution must be completed and this meant to put the fundamental sectors of the economy in the hands of the state and the state in the hands of the working class. Also present at the meeting was Iris Garcia, Minister Counsellor at the Venezuelan Embassy in Paris. She explained the importance of the process of the Bolivarian revolution but she insisted that after December 3rd what was needed was a ""revolution within the revolution"" in order to take the revolution forward. She backed up Jorge's explanation about the un-democratic nature of the Venezuelan opposition and how Manuel Rosales, the united candidate of the opposition, had been an important part of the coup plot in April 2002. Iris Garcia made an impassionate defence of the Bolivarian Revolution and thanked La Riposte for organising and promoting the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in France. A lively debate opened covering a whole range of questions, including the election of Correa in Ecuador, the mistaken position of the EZLN leadership of abstaining in the Mexican elections, and the experiences of workers control in Venezuela including the occupation of Sanitarios Maracay. The day after, on Friday, December 1st another meeting on the Venezuelan elections took place in Paris. Called by a number of solidarity organisations, including Hands Off Veneazuela, about 100 people gathered around an appeal to ""defend democracy in Venezuela"". There were a number of speakers from different organisations of the French left and the solidarity movement, and there were representatives from the Cuban, Venezuelan and Bolivian embassies present. Jorge Martin, from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign also spoke. He stressed that democracy was under threat in Venezuela on the part of the oligarchy, the owners of banks, industry and land, and imperialism, and that the reason for this was that in Venezuela there was a revolution which they wanted to put an end to. He explained how a debate has been opened in the Venezuelan Bolivarian movement about socialism and workers control and management. He said that as a socialist he thought that socialism was the democratic planning of the economy on the part of the working class, but that obviously in Venezuela there were different opinions about it. This was a crucial debate for the future of the Venezuelan revolution, he said, but for that to be able to take place we need to mobilise to defeat the counter-revolution on Sunday. These were important meetings for the solidarity movement in France which is ready to respond to any counter-revolutionary provocations of the Venezuelan oligarchs. ",NA,NA

Then we all entered into the Embassy to watch the speech that Chavez had made hours before when he announced that the main battles ahead are against the bureaucracy and corruption, people in the room cheared those remarks. After some more shouting and some juice, the ambassador explained the work of the Embassy in the last few weeks agains the media campaign of lies that the Oppossition had undertaken. Amongst other things he explained how a former diplomat had gone to Parliament invited by the Spanish Popular Party saying that he was a Venezuelan MP (which was a lie) and saying also that the level of repression in Venezuela is horrible. Thankfully the good work of the Embassy was able to stop some of those lies. After the speeches some more shouting and singing of Ali Primera followed and more leaflets to prepare for the Day of Solidarity were given away. ",NA,NA

			Solidarity takes a step forward at the second Hands Off Venezuela conference",2006-11-06T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Maarten Vanheuverswyn"," On Saturday November 4, more than two hundred people turned up for the second national Hands Off Venezuela conference in Britain. A new steering committee was elected and resolutions were passed in defence of the Bolivarian Revolution in the run up to the presidential elections, in solidarity with the struggle of the people of Oaxaca, on John McDonnell's leadership bid and on the need for joint work with other Latin American solidarity campaigns. Rob Sewell, member of the national Steering Committee, opened the conference saying that this was an historic occasion for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. One year after the first conference , the campaign has made significant progress in Britain and more support was established amongst the students and the trade unions. This conference was important because it took place one week before another conference, i.e. the first Hands Off Venezuela conference in Caracas , as a way of developing the campaign inside Venezuela itself. The other obvious link with Venezuela that was mentioned several times during the conference was the coming presidential elections, which are very crucial for the development of the Bolivarian Revolution. Rob mentioned Chavez's words that he would make the revolution ""irreversible"" after the elections, which of course fits in with the debate about socialism that is still going on unabatedly. The highlight of this year's activities was of course Hugo Chavez's visit to London (apart from the very successful meeting in Vienna ), which enabled Hands Off Venezuela to mobilise its forces. Rob recalled how Chavez created a bit of controversy in the meeting with the TUC when he started talking about the development of utopian socialism into the scientific socialism of Marx and Engels. Rob said that it was clear that the Bolivarian Revolution has great relevance for British workers too as it can serve as a great inspiration and lead to the awareness that changing society is possible. However, the Hands Off Venezuela campaign is not just about ""feeling sorry"" for the Venezuelan people, who over the last years have seen countless attacks on their president and the revolution as a whole, it is about building concrete solidarity with the revolution since it is ""our"" revolution too. Unfortunately, Ruth Winters, General Secretary of the FBU, had to give her apologies because of illness, and Tony Kearns, Deputy General Secretary of the CWU, could not attend at the last minute. The first speaker was another union General Secretary, Jeremy Dear, of the National Union of Journalists. Jeremy mainly spoke about his trip to Venezuela as part of the official TUC delegation . He described his experiences at the UNT congress and then reflected on the parallels between Nicaragua 25 years ago and Venezuela today, with both countries sharing ""the threat of a good example"". ""Nobody believes that Venezuela has become a paradise. But let's not believe that this is an unpopular regime."" Jeremy listed a whole series of achievements of the Bolivarian revolution but added that it is about more than statistics; it is about people. ""We are talking about changes that we are able to see in reality"", he added, ""like the providing of free eye operations and the food programs established under mission Mercal."" As other speakers later on, Jeremy Dear finished his contribution with a reference to the upcoming Venezuelan elections and he made it clear that this was a struggle between revolution and counterrevolution. The next speaker was Diane Raby of the Institute of Latin American Studies at the University of Liverpool. She described the revolutionary events in Venezuela as being of world importance. For the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent crisis of the left internationally, she said, the Venezuelan revolution has set a good (or bad, if you're on the other side of the barricades) example. Now it has been demonstrated again that it is possible for the left to come to power. In the past guerrilla movements were crushed, but now Venezuela has proven that it is possible to come to power in a democratic way. This, however, also means the ""power of the people"" and that the whole revolution is not just an empty word but a transformation of the traditional institutions. It is not just a matter of achieving change in parliament but only by organising in the streets, the media, the army that a transformation is possible. Diana said the revolution has been peaceful so far, but not completely, referring to the bloody events of the 1989 Caracazo , where reactionary armed forces killed thousands of people. Finally, Diane criticised those on the left who did not understand what was going on and who denied that there was a revolution taking place because it did not conform to a fixed model. She gave the example of Fidel Castro, who initially did not want to establish socialism but only moved in that direction after a period of time, being pushed by events. The last speaker in the morning was Alan Woods, editor of the Marxist.com website and one of the founders of Hands Off Venezuela. Alan recalled Chavez's speech at the United Nations and joked that something very strange happened at the UN. A man actually stood up and told the truth! ""This organisation is useless, it is dominated by imperialism and it cannot be reformed"". Chavez's radical speech obviously caused much controversy, which can only indicate one thing: the constant hate campaign directed against him is in reality fear about the revolutionary effects this is having in Latin America. Like Diane Raby, Alan went back to 1989 to denounce the hypocrisy of imperialism. When during the Caracazo more than two thousands protesters were killed following the drastic increase in prices, nobody internationally said a word about this. Where at the time were the calls for ""regime change""? Alan, speaking as a Marxist, said that in dealing with the Venezuela revolution, we have to start from the reality and not from a preconceived scheme. However, there is a big but: the revolution has not been completed and the power of the oligarchy has not been broken. Here, Alan said, we differ from the London mayor Ken Livingstone. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign is about more than cheerleading what is happening in Venezuela as that would in fact be a big mistake. The fate of the revolution is in the balance, as indicated by Chavez himself when he spoke on several occasions about the ""enemy from within"". This led Alan to touch on the question of the transformation of the state. ""It is impossible to really effect change while maintaining the old state apparatus. The problem of bureaucracy, the media and the state has to be tackled. The latest Newspeak from the media, who can no longer label him as a dictator, is to describe Chavez as an ‘elected autocrat'"". Finally, in dealing with the upcoming elections, Alan issued a sharp warning. ""The Opposition has no democratic credentials and as before it will resort to extra-parliamentary means. We are democrats but we are also realists: the fundamental questions in history have never been resolved in parliament. There is no reason why the Opposition wouldn't play any tricks again."" Hence, Alan concluded, the only way to settle this dispute is for the Bolivarian Revolution to become a socialist revolution. And the best way to help in this struggle is to fight for socialism in Britain. Then it was the turn to the audience to express its views. There were many contributions from the floor dealing with various aspects of the Venezuelan revolution such as the threat of a counterrevolution, the need for solidarity, the permanent revolution, etc. Quite a few speakers made reference to the recent events in Oaxaca, and Andy Higginbottom from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign paid tribute to the heroic struggle of the Coca Cola workers.He stressed that it was British multinationals that form a key part of the plundering of Latin America. This same point was elaborated on by a representative from the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign. Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that the main task here is indeed to build socialism in Britain but as an MP he added that the hardest place to do that is in the House of Commons. Corbyn mainly focused on the recent events in Mexico, Oaxaca in particular. Even if most of the media have ignored the issue completely, he said the scale of the electoral fraud was clear. The Labour MP said it was very exciting to see the size of the protest demonstrations, in which he also participated. This, he said, indicates that elections were only a part of the story. At the end of his speech he denounced the fact that the US Congress can apparently pass funds to finance opposition parties in Venezuela, with the arguments that ""we are a democracy so we can destroy everybody else's democracy""! After the lunch break, which was prepared by a dedicated HoV catering team, a 10 minute video clip was projected which was created by some equally dedicated HoV members who have professional video editing skills. The result was a very well done video that shows a good overview of HoV activities of the last year. The video, which also features representatives of HoV all over the world, will be available online soon. The afternoon was mainly dedicated to the moving of several political resolutions. Jorge Martin, international secretary of the campaign, moved the first resolution on the December elections. He characterised Rosales, the candidate around which the Opposition united, as being an expression of the weakness of the Opposition. Jorge dealt with the twists and manoeuvres of an ever more desperate Opposition that cannot find any mass support. As other speakers mentioned several times, the Opposition's plan is probably to withdraw from the elections and to spread all kinds of rumours about ""fraud"", which they are doing now already. This motion was carried by a big majority and an amendment that was issued at the last moment was defeated. Jorge also moved an emergency motion on Mexico, which was also amended, but this time the amendment was carried and implemented in the resolution. The second resolution was moved by Charley Allan, a member of the National Steering Committee, and dealt with Latin American solidarity. The idea of this motion is that other countries in the continent need as much solidarity as Venezuela does. In fact, it was Chavez himself who said to Jeremy Dear that Bolivia needs more help than Venezuela does! Hands Off Venezuela over the years has campaigned on many issues so in a way this motion is just a formalisation of what is already a common practice. This motion was carried too and can be read here . The third motion was moved by Pam Woods, a UNISON member, and was meant to make HoV an official supporter of the John McDonnell campaign and to support the left-wing Labour MP in his Labour leadership challenge. This motion led to a passionate debate between those who did not want to see the campaign rally around such political issues. Iain Bruce of Brighton HoV argued that the campaign should remain as broad as possible and should not exclude any people who don't agree with John's leadership challenge. This view was opposed by several other speakers from the floor who argued that we need to be practical in our support of the Venezuelan revolution. Of course the campaign should be broad but at the same time it is a simple fact that John McDonnell is a leading member of the campaign and has always defended the Venezuelan revolution and has been a great help to the campaign. In the end the motion was carried by a majority vote. A new Steering committee was also elected and all those members who had been nominated were accepted. After a brief finance report it was Ronny Pante's turn to address the conference. This student leader from Bolivar said this was a special day for him as he could see how people in Britain are willing to defend what is happening in Venezuela. He said that the interventions from the floor reflect faithfully the events in Venezuela. Ronny mainly stressed the need to advance the revolution and to carry the struggle against capitalism to an end. A broad debate about this very question is taking place in his country, which has come about naturally, as a result of the concrete needs of the revolution. He said the role of Chavez in this has been important but above all the idea of socialism should be discussed by all Venezuelan people. ""The struggle of the Venezuelan people is the struggle of all people of the world"". The second speaker was another revolutionary from Venezuela, Francisco Rivera, the National Director of Ideology of the Movements for Direct Democracy. He also said he was very moved by the conference and that he was not aware that so many people were so well informed. Francisco joked that he had noted down a list of things he was going to say but that gradually he had to scrap everything because all the points had already been made. That is why he focused his contribution to his direct experience in the revolution, that of workers' control. He has been involved in the setting up of the Revolutionary Front of Occupied Factories (FRETECO) and he described to some extent the advances that have been made in this respect. Interestingly, he referred to the expectations many people in Venezuela had that after the elections, the Venezuelan revolution will enter a new phase, a socialist phase. ""If the means of production have not been taken over yet, then that is not because of the objective situation, but because of the lack of a revolutionary leadership."" With this he referred to the impotence of the UNT to act on Chavez' slogan to occupy unproductive factories: ""factory closed, factory occupied."" The last speaker addressing the conference was John McDonnell, who just got the news that Hands Off Venezuela had voted to officially support his campaign. John apologised for being a bit late because of several meetings for his campaign he had to attend. However, he jokingly added that his delay was also caused by the bad infrastructure of the public transport system, which only illustrated the need for socialism in Britain too. John seemed annoyed about the wall of silence in the media regarding his campaign. He said it was pure arrogance of Saturday's Guardian to condemn John's stand for the Labour leadership, as if he is not to be taken seriously. ""We are serious people who are campaigning on serious issues. And one of these issues is Venezuela."" He said that finally the gloves had to be taken off and that what was needed was a Labour government that openly supports the Bolivarian Revolution. John thanked the people who launched Hands Off Venezuela and said they were the first to recognise the issue of Venezuela. He criticised the fact that as usual the right wing sprang up to split the solidarity movement, with rival campaigns set up that refuse to collaborate. He said that Hands Off Venezuela has always had a non-sectarian approach and welcomes everybody willing to actively defend the revolution. ""We will not engage in sectarian battles,"" he said. He explained the kind of threat we are faced with: that of capital. He said that as soon as you raise this you are being accused of being ""anti-American"" but added that the easiest way to counter this is to quote from American authors like Noam Chomsky. That is also what John did when he listed the long history of American intervention in Latin America, which has always been the same policy: divide the region into those who consume and supply. Latin America was one of the first areas in the world subjected to intensive exploitation, and every time this was counteracted by progressive governments, the USA always resorted to counterrevolutionary tactics and overthrew these governments with the help of the CIA. John passionately made the case that it was on this basis that all of us united to stand up against this threat. ""Venezuela is under threat, and we won't stand aside. If it wasn't under threat it wouldn't be a real revolution"". He said that the Venezuelan revolution has all the ingredients for the next step. ""Socialism is viable in the 21 st century, and I will stand up to advocate this. If you are against war, I will argue for the withdrawal from Iraq and Trident. If you are for better education, I will speak against tuition fees."" John pledged himself that if he were to become Prime Minister, in 24 hours he would break all the links with George W. Bush and that Britain would never invade other countries again. Above all, we would stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. ""Venezuela will be at the heart of the campaign."" On this militant note the second national HoV conference ended. Everybody agreed that the conference had been organised in a very democratic way and that it was significant that everybody had had plenty of opportunities to express their point of view. One thing was clear: there is an enormous enthusiasm for the Venezuelan revolution, and it is up to all of us to spread the word and help building the campaign. ",NA,NA

			Solidarity with Oaxaca in London",2006-11-21T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Charley Allan - Hands Off Venezuela"," RESPONDING to an emergency call for solidarity from the people of Oaxaca in Mexico, over 70 activists, trade unionists and politicians came together in London on Monday to protest against violent repression and electoral fraud. The international day of action, on the 96th anniversary of the Mexican revolution, was called to highlight the spate of murders, rapes and disappearances unleashed on the Oaxacan people since police and paramilitaries invaded the city at the end of October. A demand from the local teachers' union for better pay in May escalated into a full-scale mobilisation after governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz, better known by his initials URO, refused to negotiate. In London's West End, a loud and lively picket of the Mexican embassy caught the attention of many passersby. To the background of banners and placards reading ""Free Oaxaca,"" samba band Rhythms of Resistance brought a tropical beat to the grey rainy streets. Many Mexicans were present, some traveling from Cambridge, Norwich and Manchester to attend the picket. Campaigners then regrouped at the National Union of Journalists headquarters in King's Cross, where left MP Jeremy Corbyn spoke about the urgent need for solidarity with the Mexican people. The veteran activist politician, who is tipped to be foreign secretary if John McDonnell succeeds in his Labour party leadership bid, explained how left-wing presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) was robbed of the top job by ruling party candidate Felipe Calderon. Mr Corbyn pointed out that AMLO had been a popular, progressive mayor of Mexico City and ""ensured the construction of 44,000 council homes - which is 44,000 more than were constructed in this country during the same period."" He described the million-strong national democratic convention that he attended in September, at which it was ""decided that, today, November 20, AMLO should be inaugurated as the real president of Mexico. And that is exactly what is happening this evening."" A short film direct from Oaxaca was then screened, in which activists explained how the conflict had developed, making it clear that they would not back down until governor URO resigned. The film was followed by a heated but comradely debate about the best way to take the solidarity movement forward. After a discussion over aims and priorities, a solidarity committee was formed to help coordinate future actions and build a network of support. It was unanimously decided to hold another picket during Calderon's upcoming inauguration - which AMLO supporters have vowed to obstruct - on Friday 1 December, followed by a fund-raising social event. Those present also agreed to draft trade union resolutions and launch a press campaign to break the media silence on the issue. Argentina Solidarity Campaign spokeswoman Alejandra Rios, who proposed the idea of a committee, made clear the determination of everyone present. ""This is just the beginning of the campaign,"" she insisted. ""We are committed to support the people of Oaxaca's human rights, which are being violated, and we join in with their demand that URO must go."" A spokesman for Hands Off Venezuela, which had voted to sponsor the day's events at its annual conference two weeks ago, agreed. ""We must now put as much pressure on the Mexican and British governments as possible to resolve this issue without further bloodshed,"" he said. ""The will of the people must be respected."" ",NA,NA

London, November 29, 2006 We would like to express our support for the re-election of president Hugo Chavez in the forthcoming presidential election on December 3 rd , as an expression of our support for the progressive reforms particularly in the fields of education, health and the beginning of land reform. We note with great concern the manoeuvres of the opposition which seem to be aimed at looking for a justification not to recognise the result of the presidential election. The Bolivarian revolution has proven its democratic credentials on many occasions. It is precisely the opposition which has resorted to military coups, sabotage of the economy, appeals for foreign intervention, etc., in order to put an end to the Bolivarian revolution. The current opposition candidate Manuel Rosales was an active participant in the undemocratic military coup which overthrew Hugo Chavez on April 11, 2002. The Venezuelan opposition has no moral authority to complain about alleged “authoritarianism” of the Chavez administration or the “lack of transparency” in the elections. We commit ourselves to defend the democratic will of the Venezuelan people and to fight against any attempt by the oligarchy or imperialism to de-legitimise the results of the elections. We appeal to the British government to recognise the results of the presidential elections in Venezuela and not to repeat the shameful behaviour of the Foreign Office during the coup in 2002, when it recognised the illegitimate government of Carmona.

													Hands Off Venezuela"," The meeting began with the brief speeches of three comrades who promoted the founding of the campaign. Alessia Candito spoke briefly about the origins of the campaign around the coup d'état organised by the counter-revolution in 2002 as well as the campaign of attacks against Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution launched by the capitalists internationally. Since then the HOV campaign has continued to grow and today is present in more than 40 countries around the world. Elizabeth Alves and Francisco Rivero took the platform next. Finally, the founder of the International Hands off Venezuela Campaign, Alan Woods, spoke on the international situation, the struggle against imperialism and the necessity of taking the revolution to completion, to socialism. From that moment it was clear what had to be done to defend the revolution. It was decided to launch the International Hands off Venezuela Campaign. Alan explained that since those events it was possible to expropriate the oligarchy, which was defeated and divided, and to break with this unjust system forever. ""They would not have been able to offer any resistance, and at the same time, it would have been possible to finish with capitalism without any bloodshed, without civil war."" The mood of the meeting was one of enthusiasm. Alan commented that since the beginning of the revolution, with the victory of Chavez in the presidential elections in 1998, he has closely followed developments in Venezuela. When speaking about the coup which took place on April 11, 2002, which was planned by US imperialism along with the local oligarchy, Alan asked, ""Who saved the revolution?"". The audience responded, ""The people"". There are reformists who say that they see a low level of consciousness for the establishment of socialism. Alan countered this by saying ""I see a high level of consciousness."" The people, that is to say, the oppressed masses have demonstrated this high level of consciousness. ""Where was this low level of consciousness during the coup, during the bosses lockout and during the referendum?"" The people have saved the revolution in the most difficult moments and when it faces the greatest danger. The key is the rank and file. They must be organised. Alan again called on Heinz Dieterich to a public debate on the Bolivarian revolution and socialism. He criticised the ex-Marxists and ex-revolutionaries who say that the conditions do not exist for socialism. ""They never run out of excuses for avoiding the socialist revolution."" Alan recalled the declarations of Chavez stating that the main enemy was within. This enemy is the cancer of the bureaucracy which weakens the process from within in order to smash it. Furthermore, repeating what the President had said, that much of this bureaucracy is old, from the Fourth Republic. However there is another new layers the ""Bolivarian bureaucracy"". This layer dresses itself in red but does not represent the people. Alan asked the audience: ""How many bureaucrats are there?"" The audience answered, ""Very few"". ""There are more of us,"" Alan said, ""and few of them"". The key is from below, not from above. There were many interesting interventions and questions to the speakers, such as a woman who asked whether Hands of Venezuela was a new party, as well as from a professor who insisted on the necessity of arming ourselves ideologically to take the revolution forward. Alan Woods closed the meeting by responding that Hands off Venezuela was a campaign open to debate. ""Of course, we will not allow escualidos or counter-revolutionaries to join"" (laughter) in reference to what the professor had said earlier, saying that it was necessary to have a debate to clarify things. ""As a Marxist I believe that the only ideology that can guarantee the victory of the revolution is Marxism. But there are some who ask, why defend something old? We must come up with something innovative, something new!"" To this Alan replies ""We defend old ideas, because we face the same old problems"" (applause from the audience). Simon Bolivar's struggle took place 200 years ago. The oligarchy has had all this time to do something. But what have they done? They have betrayed Bolivar. They fractured and divided Latin America, to make it a slave in the service of North American imperialism. Bolivar's vision of uniting the people is still relevant today. But this can only be achieved from below, by expropriating the oligarchy, and through the construction of a Socialist Federation of Latin America and the World. The Venezuelan people can only rely on the workers, peasants, poor and youth of the world."" Alan ended with a call to continue the struggle: ""Nobody should leave without joining HoV."" All of those present expressed their commitment to building the campaign in Venezuela. ",NA,NA

													Charley Allan at UCU - Morning Star"," Hundreds of activists at the Hands Off Venezuela conference on Saturday pledged their support for Labour leadership contender John McDonnell in his bid to become the next prime minister. by Charley Allan at UCU In an electric atmosphere at the second annual general meeting of Hands Off Venezuela, a comradely debate examined the role of campaigners within the solidarity movement and praised Mr McDonnell for his “consistent support for President Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution.” Those opposed to the motion described it as “bonkers,” because it could, potentially, alienate people from the campaign. Moving the resolution, which was carried with an 80 per cent majority, steering committee member Pam Woods condemned “the anti-Venezuela position of Tony Blair,” urging “members of Hands Off Venezuela to promote the candidature for Labour leadership of John McDonnell.” Other motions passed on the day included a commitment to backing all solidarity organisations “taking the initiative” in supporting “progressive social movements in Latin America.” Bolivia Solidarity Campaign chairwoman Amancay Colque said: “With the help of Hands Off Venezuela, after just two pickets we forced multinational corporation Grant Thornton to extinguish their power of attorney over the tin mines in Huanuni.” Of particular concern for conference was the grave situation of the Mexican social movements, condemning that country’s recent electoral fraud and repression of striking teachers in Oaxaca. An emergency resolution supporting the rights of the Mexican people against imperialism and corruption was amended to instruct practical solidarity work by Hands Off Venezuela and other affiliated groups. On November 20, which is the day that “cheated” presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is due to be inaugurated as “parallel president,” it was agreed to hold a picket outside the Mexican embassy, followed by a rally at a central London venue. Jeremy Corbyn MP, who is set to become foreign secretary under a John McDonnell premiership, explained: “The radical tide of Latin America affects everybody in the whole continent. “Many Mexicans have a very hard life in the United States, but they’re not prepared to take this crap any longer.” Mr McDonnell revealed: “On every platform on my campaign trail, I’ve raised the issue of Venezuela. What we want now is a clear-cut commitment from the Labour government that it supports the Venezuelan revolution.” To standing ovations, he promised “to break the military alliance with George Bush within 24 hours” if he wins the leadership contest.

			First meeting of Hands Off Venezuela committee in Caracas",2006-11-01T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Patrick Larsen in Caracas"," On Thursday October 26 th , a small but important meeting was held at the Bolivarian University of Venezuela (UBV) in Caracas. The aim was to set up a committee that can organise the Hands Off Venezuela campaign within Venezuela itself. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign, which is now active in more than 30 countries, has from its very beginning been in contact with wide layers of sympathizers and activists within the revolutionary movement in Venezuela. A network of people collaborating with the campaign has existed for some years now and it has been helping with a number of practical and political aspects; sending articles and reports on major events to the international HOV Campaign website, arranging for revolutionary Venezuelan activists to go on speaking tours in other countries, making the achievements of the HOV campaign known within Venezuela, etc. However, this network has existed on a more or less informal basis. The decision has now been taken to set up the campaign in an organised and official manner. The meeting at the UBV gathered various activists from different sectors of the revolutionary movement; comrades working in the Ministry of Culture, employed in PDVSA (the state-owned oil company), journalists from different media outlets, functionaries of the Alcaldía Mayor, activists in the UNT (National Union of Workers) and comrades from the Revolutionary Marxist Tendency (CMR). Comrades from the Ezquiel Zamora Peasants' Front, the youth organization Patria Joven and the Ideological Coordinator of the MDD (Movement for Direct Democracy) sent their apologies for not being able to attend, but showed interest in learning more about the campaign and see how they can collaborate. The meeting was opened by Alessía Candito, an Italian journalist living in Caracas. She introduced the background of the HOV campaign, its achievements throughout the world and its basic aims and methods of work. Alessia explained that the HOV campaign was founded at the time of the bosses' lockout in December 2002, on the initiative of Alan Woods, a British Marxist theoretician, who made an appeal to the international labour movement to defend the Bolivarian revolution against the attacks of imperialism. Alessia went on to explain the achievements of the campaign, the consistent work of British HOV supporters in the trade unions resulting in the adoption of a solidarity resolution at the TUC congress, the amazing event organized by HOV in Vienna with Chavez speaking about Socialism and Revolution to a meeting of 5000 people, etc. She emphasized the focus of the HOV campaign towards the labour movement and the trade unions as the only way of spreading solidarity on a massive scale and making sure that solidarity is seen as an active commitment to the cause of the revolution. According to the comrade, the basic aims of setting up a branch of the HOV campaign within Venezuela itself, are on the one hand to strengthen knowledge about the revolutionary process in other countries and on the other hand to make the people of Venezuela aware of the fact that they are not alone in their struggle. She stressed that the second point has a political importance. Many of the supporters of reformist positions use the supposed isolation of the Bolivarian revolution as an argument for more moderate positions. If, on the contrary, the people learn that workers and youth throughout the world see Venezuela as an example of resistance and revolution, this can inspire the revolutionary rank and file to go further and radicalise the revolution. After her lead-off there was a debate where a number of those present intervened with different questions and opinions. Some doubted the emphasis on the orientation towards the labour movement and a debate took place on the role of the working class within the revolution. These comrades argued that because of the small size of the proletariat and the big proportion of employed in the state sector, the working class cannot play the same role as in other revolutions, and that the campaign therefore should consider this. These arguments were answered by Jacobo Mora, an ex-leader of the Communist Party and former Vice-Minister of Health in the Bolivarian government. This comrade made clear that history has shown time and again that no revolution can be victorious without the conscious intervention of the working class. He also pointed out that the Venezuelan workers have played a key role in defending the revolution and the Bolivarian government, giving the example of the PDVSA workers at Puerto la Cruz who fought to maintain the refinery going in spite of the bosses' lockout. This and other such actions were what really saved the revolution. After this discussion, it was agreed that it is crucial to use the HOV campaign to strengthen the ties with the UNT trade union movement and the FRETECO (Movement of occupied factories). The meeting concluded with a short session on the different tasks of the HOV committee in Caracas. It was agreed to organise a big launch meeting of the campaign on Monday, 20 th November with the presence of various revolutionary officials and Alan Woods, the founder of the international campaign. This meeting will obviously be an important event in the setting up of the campaign, which will be followed up by different press conferences and public meetings that the HOV campaign will organize during the elections. At the end of November, Hands Off Venezuela will organize delegations from Britain, the US, Sweden and other countries to go to Venezuela. This will be an important step in the building of the campaign giving it an internationalist and anti-imperialist character. Taking advantage of the presence of comrades from other countries, the HOV campaign in Caracas will intervene actively in the elections and spread solidarity and make the Venezuelan people aware of the fact that there are thousands of revolutionary fighters throughout the world that are following the events in Venezuela closely and are ready to defend it against the attacks of imperialism.

													Daniel Morey - HOV Norwich"," Ronny Pante continued his speaking tour of UK universities at the University of East Anglia in Norwich on 26 th October, continuing to prove that youth in Britain feel solidarity and excitement towards the revolutionary movement in Venezuela. The mood at the meeting was eager, with a great deal of questions on how we can make our own desire for a transition from capitalism to socialism concrete. Ronny spoke to around 25 students, giving an extensive insiders perspective on the background to and history of the revolutionary reawakening taking place since the 1989 Caracazo. Based on the nature and extent of the subsequent questions from students, it would seem that many in the audience felt the insider's description gave revolution a tangible spirit, which will hopefully lead to a growing movement at this university. After the talk and lengthy period of questioning, several students stayed behind to chat, sign up to Hands off Venezuela and buy pamphlets and books from Ronny. However, unfortunately the informal chat could not last long as Ronny had to rush off to catch a train back to London. Hopefully this should not be a problem, as we have many more events planned at the university to encourage and express the enthusiasm that has been shown. In a week's time we have a showing of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised , and then Diana Raby is speaking on her new book followed by a showing of The Old Man and Jesus . Before the election on 3 rd December, we plan to have a campaign to really raise awareness of the dynamic, living reality of the situation in Venezuela and to bring students in to actively organising in support and solidarity of the campaign. We are also running a broad based campaign against the government's ‘suggestion' that lecturers spy on Muslim pupils, which has the potential to show that socialism means actively changing the world. If all goes well, we will end the year having passed Student Union Council resolutions against the government's attack on civil liberties and in support and affiliation to Hands off Venezuela . Ronny's visit has highlighted that student politics can and is helping change the world for the better. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela"," Venezuelan presidential elections and the need to step up solidarity work The presidential elections in Venezuela in December will mark an important turning point for the Bolivarian Revolution. What is at stake is not only who will be the next president of Venezuela, but the future of the revolutionary process itself. The Bolivarian Revolution has already delivered massive social gains for the Venezuelan people, particularly in the field of education (including the eradication of illiteracy), the provision of health care to the poor, and the beginning of land reform. This has strengthened mass support for the Bolivarian revolution. These policies have aroused the rage of the US administration, and their Venezuelan allies in the local oligarchy, which see them as a threat. Venezuela has not only defied the policies that Washington is imposing on the whole of the continent, but has then also resisted and defeated two attempted coups. This has inspired and encouraged the masses of the whole of the continent in their struggle against imperialist domination, poverty and exploitation. The Venezuelan opposition (which really responds to the interests of Washington), has been defeated on a number of occasions. In the short term they cannot organize a military coup against the Bolivarian Revolution. But that does not make them less dangerous. As proven on December 2005 when they withdraw from the National Assembly elections, they do not believe they can defeat Chavez and the Revolution through peaceful parliamentary means. Their candidate in the December 3 rd presidential elections, Zulia governor, Manuel Rosales, participated in the coup of April 11 th 2002 and signed the infamous Carmona decree which disbanded all democratic institutions in the country. One of his first actions after being chosen as the joint opposition candidate was to pay a visit to Miami. It is unlikely that he can win a clean race against Chavez. The opposition will probably withdraw and try to make the elections appear as illegitimate. This will go hand in hand with a campaign in the media internationally to give credence to this allegation. This campaign has already started and includes all sorts of outrageous accusations (from Venezuela's lack of cooperation with the war on drugs, to the alleged links between the Venezuelan government and Islamic terrorism, etc) The US has already announced the creation of a new CIA Mission dealing with Cuba and Venezuela. Knowing the CIA's past record in relation to Cuba we can realize the dangers this implies. Hugo Chávez has already denounced publicly the possibility of attempts on his life. For all these reasons, it is now more important than ever to step up the activities of the movement in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. We pledge ourselves to counter the campaign of media lies and misinformation, to disseminate truthful information about the achievements of the Bolivarian movement and to defend the revolution against internal and external threat. Latin American Solidarity Conference rocognises that the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela is happening within a wider struggle for peace and socialism in the region; that progressive social movements across Latin America face the same enemies, namely imperialism, the multinational corporations and local oligarchies; and that solidarity at a local, national, regional and international level is crucial to defending democracy and promoting vital unity. Therefore, it pledges to support the progressive social movements in Latin America and, where appropriate, their elected governments; attempt to work with all other solidarity organisations in Britain that are taking the initiative in this matter; and help coordinate joint activities with these groups to build the widest possible base to counter the attacks on the popular democratic will of the Latin American people. Pro-Bolivarian Labour Leader Conference condemns the anti-Venezuelan position of the British government under Tony Blair; notes that things are unlikely to get better in this respect with Gordon Brown as his successor; and therefore urges members of Hands Off Venezuela to promote the candidature for Labour leader of John McDonnell MP, who has openly and consistently expressed his support for President Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution. Visit John McDonnell's campaign website Solidarity with Oaxaca Conference expresses its solidarity with the struggle of the people of Mexico and particularly of Oaxaca for their rights, against electoral fraud and repression. Hands Off Venezuela will liaise with other solidarity organisations and activists to organise a protest action in London on November 20th, the day in which a call has been made in Mexico for a national stoppage.

			Terneuzen: first meeting of Hands Off Venezuela in the Netherlands",2006-10-20T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Hands Off Venezuela was invited in September by the trade union ABVAKABO, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen branch, to provide information during a solidarity evening for Venezuela. Following the Flemish day of solidarity with Venezuela, the campaign is blowing across the border. Luk Brusselaers was so enthusiastic about the meeting in Antwerp in April that he convinced his local trade union branch to invite the members of Hands Off Venezuela to Terneuzen. ABVAKABO is more or less the Dutch sister of the ACOD, i.e. the socialist trade union for public service employees. Notice of the meeting was circulated beforehand throughout the ABVAKABO via their members' magazine AANEEN. Various positive reactions were received from trade unionists, from Groningen and Amsterdam among others. The local press also found room for announcements with accompanying articles: ""Union holds Venezuela evening"" (PZC 14/09/06) and ""Focus on Venezuela at trade union meeting"" (BN/De stem 14/09/06). The articles in both newspapers opened as follows: ""It won't be widely known that the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, is an honorary member of a Belgian trade union, and neither that his ‘Bolivarian' revolution is supported by the English and Italian trade union movements. But the ABVAKABO makes it clear that they stand behind their sister unions. With a film screening and lecture, this evening in Terneuzen, they want to stimulate international solidarity. The way in which Venezuela is developing under Chavez's leadership, is diametrically opposed to that of the European countries. While Europe opts for a free market, privatisation and cutbacks in medical and social services, in Venezuela companies are being nationalised and the profits used for those services and for free education."" Today's Europe opts unequivocally for the free market. The six commandments of the free market have become sacrosanct: globalisation, technological innovation, liberalisation, deregulation, privatisation and competition. The results of this are the dismantling of social and medical services, increasing redundancies, a structural unemployment problem, more pressure at work, longer working hours etc. Trade unions look on in horror and demand urgent solutions. It is for this reason that trade unionists are beginning to look towards the Bolivarian Revolution. Over the wall ABVAKABO Zeeuws-Vlaanderen is the smallest branch in the country. Due to good campaign work their meeting room in Terneuzen was filled with 22 people, with every chair occupied. Among them of course were various trade union members, but there was also an SP council member and a Venezuelan woman. As soon as she saw our stand with material, the Venezuelan said enthusiastically: ""Hands Off Venezuela! Chavez has said so much about you in London! It's good that you are here."" The vice-chairperson Bernadette Menu, who presided over the evening, explained that the ABVAKABO Zeeuws-Vlaanderen wanted to take a look ""over the wall"" of local trade union practice, by organising an information evening to look at the Venezuela of today with the trade union of tomorrow in mind. She welcomed the members of Hands Off Venezuela, after which the documentary The Revolution will not be Televised was shown. The audience was absolutely fascinated by this political thriller about the coup d'état against Chavez in 2002. Everyone watched with bated breath. After the documentary Erik Demeester of Hands Off Venezuela provided some clarification on the revolutionary process. He explained how today's Venezuela forms a concrete example of an alternative model of society. In this context Chavez symbolises a mass movement of the grass roots. The population of Venezuela participates in the political process, and the political process is for the people. The new constitution forms the basis of a participatory democracy. Through nationalisation the people regain their grip on the economy. Profits are used for free education, medical and social services. In this way the welfare of the population has been impressively improved. At last people have hope again... With this unique and peaceful political process of self-organisation of the people, Venezuela is a true pioneer. The trade unions play an essential role in all this - in fact some companies are now run by the workers themselves. The proceeds flow back to them and to social programmes. This social model chooses solidarity above profit maximisation. It's hardly surprising that such a movement terrifies the establishment and that Chavez finds himself under immense international pressure. The Revolution will not be Televised is the filming of the failed coup organised by the CIA in 2002. The people spontaneously took to the streets and peacefully restored power. Chavez was liberated by the people! According to opinion polls he will again obtain a majority in the presidential elections on December 3 rd , 2006. In the past he attained the sort of absolute majorities that other presidents only dream of! Meanwhile his popularity continues to grow. Inspiring debate After this explanation by Erik Demeester the debate was opened to the audience. A trade union member wondered why there is so much ignorance in the Netherlands about Venezuela. The media are apparently not as independent as one might hope. The press marginalises events by means of a policy of meagre and above all negative reporting. The expectation is that after the election they will present Chavez again as a diabolical dictator. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign wishes to provide an antidote to this, informing the public about the revolution in Venezuela and making people here conscious of the fact that there isn't a dictatorship there, but rather new hope. The movement in Venezuela is under enormous pressure from international imperialism. Our solidarity is tremendously important for Venezuela, and also for the rest of the world. The model also offers new perspectives for trade unions. A trade unionist argued that trade unions are again in need of an ideology, and that Venezuela is pointing in the right direction. It is tremendously important that the work of the campaign is also continued in the Netherlands. The Dutch media and politicians are sharply critical of Venezuela. A few months ago, for instance, they accused Chavez of planning an invasion of the Antilles. Here the Dutch government was playing along with Bush's campaign of dirty tricks to internationally discredit the Bolivarian Revolution and pave the way for a possible military invasion. In Terneuzen, however, an Antillean pointed out that the Antilles did not experience any colonial repression at the hands of Venezuela, but rather from the Netherlands. He added that many Antilleans would themselves very much appreciate a taste of the Bolivarian Revolution so that they also could have free education and health care. Inspired by the heat of the debate, some of those present immediately decided to hold another meeting before the elections. They will stay in contact in order to organise another evening elsewhere in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. The purpose of the evening was after all to get the solidarity campaign going in the Netherlands. It can serve as an example for other Dutch trade union branches. After the debate, the Venezuelan woman asked if she could say something. "" Thank you Hands off Venezuela for what you are doing for my people."" Then the words stuck in her throat and she began to cry. These emotions show how deeply the Bolivarian revolution is felt. It also shows how important international solidarity is for the Venezuelan people. Many of those present stayed and talked for another hour.

			Venezuelan student leader kicks off speaking tour in Britain",2006-10-24T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Maarten Vanheuverswyn"," Last night was the first of many events organised by Hands Off Venezuela featuring Ronny Pante, general coordinator of the Integrated Students' Movement in Bolivar, Venezuela, who is touring British universities to explain why students and activists in this country should care about what is happening in Venezuela. More than 40 people turned up at SOAS University in London to hear the reflections of an experienced Venezuelan student leader on the Venezuelan Revolution. After thanking the HoV campaign for organising the speaking tour and stressing the importance ""of having a platform through which we can counter the media lies"", Ronny started his speech with an anecdote. Back in April 2002, he said, nobody knew what was happening during the coup. The media in Venezuela were only showing cartoons and soap operas and were not telling the truth. Ronny and other students had to turn to the BBC London radio service to find out about the demonstrations that were springing up all over the country that were to prove decisive in reinstating president Chavez. The turbulent events of 2002 clearly posed the need for a strategy to counter the disinformation, which is where the Hands Off Venezuela campaign can help. Ronny went on to describe the revolutionary process that is taking place in Venezuela and pointed out that this didn't actually start with the electoral victory of Chavez in 1998 but goes back to 1989. The Caracazo was the name given to the protests against the neo-liberal package introduced by Carlos Andres Peres, the then Venezuelan president. The strangling of the economy led to a social explosion in which thousands were killed by the army and the police. Against this background Hugo Chavez became a popular figure and managed to galvanise support amongst the masses. After going to jail for a few years Chavez was released and in 1998 he won the presidential elections. However, it would be wrong to see all of this as the work of one man; what is important is the role that ordinary men and women played over the last decade. After briefly touching upon the role of the universities in the revolution, which have always been in the vanguard of the struggle, Ronny listed some clear achievements of the revolution. The Chavez government has implemented a whole range of social programs. With Mision Robinson 1.5 million Venezuelans have been lifted out of illiteracy and Mision Rivas has brought secondary education to hundreds of thousands of people. Cuban doctors work close to the people and free healthcare is available for everybody. One of the more recent misiones is a continuation of the mision Bario Adentro and is set to transform the hospitals. However, the most important mision is the transformation of the people themselves, who have gained a real sense of dignity after years of oppression. Despite all the achievements, Ronny said, which have all come about through democratic decision-making, there are still a lot of contradictions in Venezuelan society. One of the main problems is the presence of a bureaucracy that blocks the process from going further ahead. The people want to see change, not bureaucratic procedures. One of the main battles ahead is precisely this one, as has been recognised by Chavez himself on many occasions. Ronny said he welcomed a debate on these questions, as it is clear some elements in the constitution help to maintain capitalism in Venezuela. Another big debate in the run-up to the election of December 3 - with the main slogan being ""10 million votes for Chavez"", a very ambitious target considering that only 14-15 million people are registered to vote - is the question of the ""unified party"". Chavez has opened the debate on the need to build such a party with the idea that there are so many different parties standing for the same thing, thus creating unnecessary divisions. This, as with so many questions, is a debate that is going on in Venezuela right now and in which the student movements are also fully participating. At the end of his speech, Ronny turned back to the question of solidarity. He stressed that international solidarity has had an important effect on activists in Venezuela itself. They feel strengthened knowing they have support abroad and are not alone in their struggle. But this is also true for Chavez himself, who has looked for links abroad and has on several occasions expressed his appreciation for solidarity events like the one organised in Austria. ""What will happen in the world will decide what happens in Venezuela. On the other hand, what will happen in Venezuela will also have a big effect on what is happening in the world."" With these words Ronny finished his contribution and was received by a big applause from the audience. After Espe Espigares, a member of the national HoV steering committee, advertised the coming Hands Off Venezuela national conference, where Ronny will also be present, the time had come for questions and contributions from the floor. There was a lively question and answer session and various contributions were made by members of the audience. The first question was about the coming elections and whether Chavez was going to allow international observers or not. Ronny pointed out that it was not in Chavez' powers to decide on this question. The CNE, the National Electoral Council, is the official body that is dealing with this. The Opposition claims Chavez holds power over the CNE, which is not true, and in any case there is a long list of international observers that will closely monitor the elections. Another question was about the role of the students in the revolution, which Ronny dealt with to some extent in his reply. Ronny said that the vast majority of students support the revolution and are not just active in their universities. In fact, university students have been a massive voluntary force who went into the communities for example to identify the amount of illiterate people. In this way they are a kind of brigades doing social research. Students participate in all mass movements. In their discussions with the communities they serve three roles: They do all of this without forgetting about their own rights like good public transport to the university, more facilities, etc. Ronny recalled how they had mobilised against an increase in public transport fares and stopped it after taking over the town hall. Other questions were asked about the land reform. This, Ronny said, is indeed one of the key issues for the development of socialism in Venezuela. The ""war against the latifundia"" is one of the main tasks set by the revolution as so much land is left idle and has the potential to lift many landless peasants out of poverty. Here also there are many contradictions that have to be resolved. Some official functionaries with their own interests are against the expropriations of big landowners and refuse to redistribute idle land amongst the poor peasants. A real struggle is going on even though the debate has subsided now in order to maintain unity on the eve of the elections. Because there are so many different interests involved, this debate will undoubtedly continue after the elections and will have to be resolved one way or another. For his part, Ronny made it clear that the solution to the poverty in the countryside is to take over the land and to put it back in production. Some speakers from the floor made contributions about ""socialism of the 21 st century"" as proclaimed by President Chavez and asked for clarification about this concept. Ronny said that Chavez originally advocated a rather nationalist program of limited reforms and didn't raise the question of socialism. Because of the pressure from US imperialism and the concrete problems of the masses he was forced, however, to look towards socialism in a concrete way. Chavez has clearly been influenced by different people with different ideas. Right now the debate about ""socialism of the 21 st century"" is still going on and the word ""socialism"" can be interpreted in various ways. Some intellectuals argue that this socialism has nothing to do with that of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Others argue that socialism means the expropriation of the main levers of the economy, putting them to good use, and also workers' control in the factories, as is already happening in several factories. Here too there are contradictions coming to the surface, not in the least in the government itself. Ronny maintained that once workers' control over the means of production is proven in practice, this could push Chavez to go further than is the case now. The whole debate about socialism of the 21 st century is of course also a debate about the fundamentals of the Marxist theory of the state. Ronny holds the position that the misiones , however good in themselves, are not good enough and have to be complemented by the taking over of the main levers of the economy. This debate is also open and is a battle between reformists and revolutionaries. Finally, the debate went beyond the borders of Venezuela with a brief discussion on what is happening in Mexico. Unfortunately, there has been very little information in the mainstream press about the electoral fraud in the recent Mexican presidential elections. These and many other questions were discussed in and after the meeting, which all pointed to the same conclusion: now more than ever international solidarity is needed in order to counter the disinformation about the revolutionary process developing in the whole of Latin America.

													Rodrigo Trompiz - HOV"," On 18 September, Rodrigo Cháves, the Venezuelan foreign affairs minister for Europe, met with representatives from various solidarity campaigns who do work with Venezuela, including HOV, Global Women's Strike, VSC, VICUK and the Isaías Medina Angarita Bolivarian Circle. HOV founder Alan Woods led a call for greater unity between the campaigns, unity that has been conspicuous by its absence of late. We will always have differences of opinion, he said, but these are irrelevant when confronted with the bigger picture of providing the Bolivarian revolution with the support it needs. This is particularly important with the upcoming presidential elections. Rodrigo Cháves echoed this view, stressing that unity was vital. We need to ""de-institutionalise"" solidarity, he emphasised.

			Hands Off Venezuela at the Manchester anti-war demonstration",2006-09-26T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Pablo Roldan"," Hands off Venezuela supporters joined the anti-war movement in Manchester on Saturday, September 23. Along with thousands of people we marched and denounced the imperialist wars that the British government is waging in Iraq and Afghanistan, demanding the immediate end to the occupation of these countries and the withdrawal of British troops from them. The march, which was called by the Stop the War Coalition, took place on the eve of the Labour Party conference and was, in fact, a massive message of rejection of Blair and Blairism, not only of his foreign policy but also of his social and economic policies in Britain. Hands off Venezuela ran a very successful stall in Albert Square and also organised a meeting in which the latest developments in the revolutionary processes in Venezuela and Mexico were discussed and put into context. The stall attracted a lot of interest and we sold out of copies of the new Hands Off Venezuela magazine. It was noticeable that quite a lot of people had heard Chavez's speech at the United Nations. Also a few of the demonstrators from Arab countries explained that Chavez has become extremely popular in the Arab world, since he is seen as someone who stands up to the power of US imperialism, unlike the leaders of the Arab world. Jorge Martin, International Secretary of the Campaign, addressed an overwhelmingly young group of around 35 people, which, given the fact the many people had come from outside Manchester and that the march was delayed, was more than a respectable number. Jorge began his speech by offering a brief, accurate and up to date summary of the Venezuelan revolutionary process, and later went in to a more in depth analysis of the current situation and the dangers that the revolution faces. ""In my opinion,"" he said, ""unless the revolutionary movement moves towards the expropriation of the landlords, banks and big monopolies the revolution is and will be in danger of being defeated at any time. Venezuela not only faces the threat of imperialist intervention from outside its borders but also from within. The oligarchy in Venezuela, which still pulls the strings of the economy through their control of banks, media and big monopolies, are the agents of imperialism in Venezuela. They have tried to overthrow the democratically elected government of President Chavez through violence and sabotage, practices that they still pursue and advocate, and no doubt they will try again as soon as they see a favourable situation for them."" ""Also, as Chavez himself has recognised, another important threat that the revolution faces is corruption and bureaucratism."" He mentioned how president Chavez, in a recent interview to Panorama, referred to this: ""The main threat is within. There is a constant bureaucratic counter-revolution. I am an enemy on a daily basis. I have to walk around with a whip, because I am being attacked from all sides by this enemy, the old bureaucracy and a new one which resists changes. So much so that I have to be constantly en guard when I give an instruction, and follow it up so that it is not stopped, or diverted, or minimised by this bureaucratic counter-revolution which exists within the state. This would be one of the elements of the new phase that we are entering in: the transformation of the State."" Jorge then moved on to discuss Mexico and explained the struggle of millions of people against the rigging of the presidential elections, reminding all those present that Chávez's government had not yet recognised Felipe Calderón as president of Mexico. ""In Oaxaca,"" he said, ""a teachers strike for better conditions and wages has become, in the process of struggle against the forces of repression, an insurrectionary movement that has wrested from the state functions such as security, policing, transport, food distribution, etc. This has created a situation in which the APPO (Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca), which is actually running the city as the only legitimate organ of power, has banned the governor from entering the city and has occupied private means of communications, radio and TV stations, to break the information blackout that the private media had imposed on their struggle. ""These struggles in Oaxaca are already having important consequences in the United States, for instance, when the university radio station that the movement was using to broadcast their messages was destroyed with sulphuric acid by an infiltrated agent, a call for help was issued and in just a couple of days more than $200,000 were raised amongst Mexican workers immigrants in the USA"". Jorge then highlighted that these struggles are not just taking place in a distant country in Latin America but that, essentially, people in Mexico, Venezuela or Bolivia are fighting against the same policies that we in Europe are fighting against - against privatisation, attacks on working conditions and workers' rights, attacks on pensions, state education and the health services. He finished his intervention and opened the floor for contributions and questions by referring again to president Chávez, who in 2006 at the World Social Forum in Caracas, insisted that, ""we are not here to waste time, we are talking about saving life on the planet, we are talking about saving the human species, changing the course of history, changing the world"", and stressed the need to build ""a grand worldwide anti-imperialist, alternative movement, that will engage the entire world and that has the capacity to connect, grow, and fight."" Taking up Chavez's call, Jorge explained that ""the best solidarity we can show the Bolivarian Revolution is to join the revolutionary struggle everywhere"". ",NA,NA

			British Hands Off Venezuela Electoral Delegation 2006",2006-10-06T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Dear Friends, The December 3 rd Presidential elections in Venezuela are already the target of a mass campaign of lies and deception sponsored by the U.S. State Department and its allies. The revolutionary movement in Venezuela, with massive health and education programmes funded by the democratically elected Chavez government, has succeeded in providing free health care for millions, in eradicating illiteracy, and in redistributing land and wealth to the poor. But in so doing the people of Venezuela have challenged the interests of the local and foreign business elite, especially in the United States, who have responded with a vicious and illegal campaign of sabotage. This campaign will only intensify, as we get closer to the election. We therefore call on all those who support the social movements in Venezuela, and oppose the U.S. backed acts of sabotage, to help present the truth about the Bolivarian Revolution to the people of Britain. The British Hands Off Venezuela (HOV) campaign has organised hundreds of public events around the country over the last three years to help build links between the workers in Venezuela and the workers here in Britain, and to counter the disinformation circulated by our right-wing press. We are now pleased to announce that we are sending a delegation to Venezuela to coincide with the Presidential elections . The weeklong tour will begin on Monday, November 27 th and finish on Sunday December 3 rd - election day. We have arranged low cost accommodation in Caracas, and encourage people to stay longer if they can, as there are sure to be mass rallies with President Hugo Chavez speaking before and after the December 3 rd elections, as well as many other opportunities to see the Bolivarian Revolution up close. We will be part of an international HOV delegation, working with HOV Venezuela and we hope to link up with other similar delegations from Australia and Ireland. We will be bringing our message of opposition to U.S. intervention, while building stronger ties between British and Venezuelan working people and activists. We will focus our delegation on meeting with state and community media representatives ( ViveTV , CatiaTV , Radio Ali Primera and the recently established AvilaTV), labour activists, and workers in the occupied factories of Inveval and SelFex , and the Calle y Media collective, whose films ""Venezuela Bolivariana"" and ""The Old Man and Jesus"" have helped educate tens of thousands around the world. However, we will not be visiting Venezuela as ""revolutionary tourists"" - we will be building solidarity with Venezuela before and after the delegation itself, through a series of educational events, fundraisers, and report-backs across the UK. All those joining this delegation must be dedicated defenders of the Venezuelan revolution, and committed to building solidarity. Following on from the successful visit of Orlando Chirino to London, and more recently by Hugo Chavez himself, we will be making connections for other prominent Bolivarian Revolutionary activists to visit throughout 2007. We ask our supporters to help make this delegation a success. Keep an eye out for local events and activities, or consider hosting a local educational event or fundraiser for the campaign yourself. We have several films available which make it easy to organise even a small gathering to discuss events in Venezuela. Please consider making a donation to Hands Off Venezuela in order to make this delegation possible. Donations of any amount are greatly appreciated.

													Pablo Roldán - HOV"," On Tuesday, September 19, the Battersea and Wandsworth Trade Union Council (BWTUC) launched its Youth Network with a colourful and lively party in Tooting, south west London. BWTUC Youth Network has been set up with the aim of bringing together young activists, campaigners and trade unionists. With that ultimate goal in mind, a series of solidarity campaigns and organisation, like Cuba Solidarity Campaign or Banana Link were invited to the launching party. Hands off Venezuela was present with a stall full of material (books, DVD's, Magazines, T-shirts, etc ) and a speaker, Jorge Martin, International Secretary of the Campaign. Jorge started out his journey through the history of the Venezuelan revolution and the Bolivarian movement by warning against the falsehoods and lies that the media in Britain is spreading about what the Venezuelan and State. ""Last Thursday - he said - the Evening Standard carried an article on Venezuela depicting it as a totalitarian regime with death squads and no freedom of speech. However, the opposite is the truth. The freedom of expression is such that the media, TV channels and newspapers alike, which are mainly dominated by the opposition, run articles asking for the violent overthrow of the government. That is something that nowhere else, and least of all in Britain, would be tolerated."" He later went on to explain the social conquest that the Revolution has brought to the Venezuelan masses, like free and comprehensive education and health care, and contrasted these gains with the situation in Britain, where all the working class conquest, that so dearly were paid for by the workers in Britain, are been constantly eroded. ""In that sense - he said - what is happening in Venezuela is a most inspirational example for all of us who are fighting here against privatisations, free education and a comprehensive and free to the point of need National Health Service. Jorge then linked the struggle of the Venezuelan masses to take their destiny in their own hands and shake off their necks the double yoke of American imperialism and their own bourgeoisie with the struggles that are now arisen throughout Latin American, as the Mexican mobilisation against electoral fraud. ""We, in Hands off Venezuela - he said - have been working to raise awareness about what is happening in Venezuela since the April Coup in 2002 and to finish off my intervention I want to raise two points that I think are extremely important. ""The first one is the issue of workers control in factories and industries. For instance, the case of Alcasa, an aluminium State owned factory where the workers are now participating in the running of the factory at every level. They democratically elect every managerial post, save the chair which is appointed by the government. And the people is elected in these managerial position can be recalled at any time. which can be recalled at any time. ""The second issue that I want to draw to your attention is the question of socialism. After the collapse of the Soviet block there was a lot of propaganda about the end of socialism and, even, the end of history. However, now, through his own experience, Chávez has opened the debate about socialism. He's already stated that ""socialism is the only way to possibly improve the lives of the Venezuelan masses"". ""Capital around the world does not like what is happening in Venezuela. Not because it is a democratic regime, which it is, but because it is a progressive regime. They fear the effects that a good example can have in the region and throughout the world"". The party ended in great spirits with the performance of KMT, a magnificent and very inspired hip hop band with a very social and political edge. ",NA,NA

													Louise Nousratpour - Morning Star - www.morningstaronline.co.uk"," The Morning Star reports on the charged fringe meeting of Hands Off Venezuela at the Labour Party Conference, with and Jeremy Corbyn MP speaking on the Bolivarian Revolution and the movement against electoral fraud in Mexico. MPs Urge 'Direct Action' to Help Venezuela (Morning Star, Tuesday September 26 2006) by Louise Nousratpour in Manchester HANDS Off Venezuela campaigners urged the creation of a European bloc in support of the social revolution in that country and against any US military intervention yesterday. A charged fringe meeting at the Friends Meeting House in Manchester heard that US neocons are freaking out over the changes in Venezuela - as well as in Bolivia and Mexico - and could take aggressive measures to stifle it. Labour leadership contender John McDonnell MP praised Venezuela's revolution that had become a symbol of struggle for freedom around the world. But he warned of a backlash from the US and its allies, including Britain, and stressed the urgency of welding together a European bloc in support of Venezuela to ensure that it is not politically isolated. We need to take direct action and confront politicians about what they are doing to back the Chavez government against possible military action by the US, he argued, adding that a Labour government should be at the forefront of this. Fellow left MP Jeremy Corbyn delivered an eyewitness account of last month's Mexican election crisis, where the Democratic Revolution Party (DRP) lost to the pro-US National Action Party. Mr Corbyn described the millions-strong demonstrations in support of DRP leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who had submitted 900 pages of allegations of fraud which was ignored by the electoral commission. In the run-up to the elections, Mr Obrador was way ahead in poll after poll. When 95 per cent of the votes had been counted, he was the clear winner, but, bizarrely, he lost after the remaining votes were counted, recalled the MP. Mr Corbyn called on the audience to show their solidarity with Obrador's movement, because it aimed to defy the US neoliberal agenda and nationalise resources, redistribute wealth and implement an anti-poverty strategy. Hands Off Venezuela national committee member Rob Sewell said that people in Britain must start fighting their corner and urged the Bolivarisation of the Labour Party to bring it back to its roots. Finally, Mr McDonnell praised Mr Corbyn's encyclopaedic knowledge of Latin America and hinted that a would have Mr Corbyn as its Foreign Secretary. *Hands Off Venezuela has organised a taking place on November 4 at the UCU headquarters in London.",NA,NA

Quite a lot of the it was on the question of how far the revolution has gone and wether it can be mantained solely on oil revenues. Ronny explained that this debate was also taking place in Venezuela itself and it had given rise to an open discussion on socialism as the only way forward. Finally, Ronny thanked all those who had helped organise the meeting, particularly Patrick Smith who is the campaigns officer of UMSU, and Rob Owen who is the president of the union, and made a passionate appeal for all students to get involved in the Stop the Fees demonstration in London on October 29th. The day after, the tour proceeded to Cambridge, where a group of students have set up a Hands Off Venezuela society. Here the debate covered a wide range of subjects, including the elections in Ecuador and Venezuela's bid for a temporary seat in the UN Security council. Asked about Venezuela's relations to North Korea, Ronny said that Venezuela was against weapons and war and had condemned North Korea's nuclear weapons test. But he insisted that the main point was that Venezuela's revolutionary government was in favour of the principle of the rights of peoples to self-determination, and that the US was being hypocritical on this issue, turning a blind eye to other country's nuclear weapons just beacuse they are friendly to her. When asked about the role of oil revenues in sustaining the social programmes, Ronny explained that this is obviously an important factor, but that without the political will, oil revenues on their own would not guarantee anything. He gave the example of Cuba, a country which has been blockaded by the US for more than 4 decades, with very limited resources after the fall of the USSR, and which still dedicates most of its limited resources to mantaining first class health and education systems. The meeting ended with a group photo of the participants making the two open hands sign which shows support for the campaign to reelect Chavez with 10 million votes in the December 3rd presidential elections.

			Three Days of Intense Activity highlights Venezuelan Revolution at LP Conference",2006-09-26T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign was engaged in a lively three days of intense activity over the last weekend of September - bringing the message of the Venezuelan Revolution to a wide audience of anti-war activists, students, trade unionists and Labour Party members. Beginning on Saturday, HOV intervened in the 50,000 strong Stop the War demonstration in Manchester with a huge stall and a massive HOV banner attached to two high pillars for all to see. During the next day, HOV activists attended the Stop the War conference, intervened in the workshop on Latin America, and signed up dozens of people for HOV. Many activists visited our stall to buy literature, magazines and DVDs, as well as to discuss developments in Venezuela. Many of these were students who were keen to help with HOV screenings at universities and colleges. In the evening, HOV attend the 150-strong rally of Labour Against the War. Again, we set up a stall outside the event which drew a great deal of interest and gave everyone material about the campaign. In the hall, we prominently displayed the national HOV banner, while many of the platform speakers, including Tony Benn, John McDonnell MP, Jeremy Corbyn MP, referred to Venezuela in their speeches. The following day, groups of HOV supporters leafleted the Labour Party conference, loudly calling for the support of the revolutionary developments in Latin America. We received a warm response from the rank and file delegates and trade unionists as we drew attention to our lunchtime fringe meeting. The fringe meeting itself was held in the Friends Meeting Place just opposite the Labour Party conference centre. Although HOV had speakers at Labour's fringe meetings in previous years, it was the first time that HOV had held its own meeting. Despite another meeting on Venezuela called at the same time by VIC, the Hands Off Venezuela meeting was packed by 1 o'clock. People were standing at the back and sitting in the aisles, while another 40 people were turned away from the meeting due to lack of space. A film crew from French national TV was also present to film John McDonnell's contribution. The enthusiastic meeting was chaired by Espe Espigares from HOV's national steering committee who highlighted the importance of the Venezuelan Revolution in the run up to the Presidential elections in December. The first platform speaker was Rob Sewell, the convener of the national steering committee, who explained that the revolutionary movements unfolding throughout the countries of Latin America were not separated events but were part of the unfolding Latin American Revolution. Rob gave an outline of the rise of Hugo Chavez, the April 2002 coup, the bosses' lockout, and the magnificent movement of the working class and the oppressed which defeated the counter-revolution. ""Now Chavez has opened up a debate on socialism"", stated Rob, ""which has raised the tasks of the Revolution to a new level. The question of a ‘revolution within the revolution' has come to the fore. Chavez has also stated that after the December election measures will be taken to make the Revolution irreversible."" Rob also called for the lessons of Venezuela to be learned here and called for the trade unions to take back the Labour Party for socialism. The next speaker was Jeremy Corbyn MP, who had just returned from Mexico. Jeremy described the ""unbelievable occasion last Saturday in Mexico City where one million delegates assembled to debate the questions of which way forward."" They voted to recognise Lopez Obrador as president of Mexico and will return to install him on 20 th November. ""The debate at this Democratic Convention was not about procedures but how to combat the whole neo-con strategy"", stated Jeremy. ""Calderon stands for the privatisation of gas, electricity and other essential services. We must express our solidarity with those fighting against this programme which threatens the very gains of the 1910 Revolution. Internationalism and solidarity means acting ourselves and linking up with those in struggle."" The final speaker was John McDonnell MP, who is standing for leader of the Labour Party . He said that his victory for leader would mark a fundamental change. ""You would know clearly which side a Labour government was on - on the side of the people against the US neo-cons"", said John. ""Venezuela has come up at every meeting I have spoken at. It represents a struggle for freedom against imperialism. Latin America has long been the area for a source of labour and raw materials for Washington. Chavez has risen up against this oppression. That is why they want to remove him. We must make sure Venezuela is not isolated and we must work to bring about a European bloc of support for Chavez and the revolution"", he said. ""Finally we must put all Labour MPs on the spot as to where they stand in every selection."" After questions and answers, the meeting - which was very enthusiastic - was asked to go back and drum up support for the Venezuelan Revolution. Above all everyone was urged to join HOV, get their union or Labour Party to affiliate to the campaign and send delegates to the national HOV conference on 4 th November . The three days of activity proved to be a roaring success. ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela"," The Venezuelan education system is being transformed under the impact of the Bolivarian revolution. Now, Hands Off Venezuela has organised the first speaking tour of a Venezuelan student activist in Britain so that we can get a first hand account of this exciting transformation. Before Chávez came to power in Venezuela, the country's educational system was ""responding to the demands, formation, and interests of the neo-liberal model ... forming people who are deeply individualistic and competitive...in an educational structure that is profoundly elitist and exclusive."" Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Venezuela's Minister of Education and Sports Aristóbulo Isturiz's words could be describing the educational systems, and particularly university systems, of just about anywhere, including Britain. In Venezuela, as elsewhere, poor students simply could not afford higher education that didn't want them to take part anyway. Things have changed. The Bolivarian University of Venezuela (UBV), occupying the former offices of state oil company PDVSA (the company's managers were sacked after twice trying to overthrow the democratically elected government), is an example not just to Latin America, but to the whole world that higher education is not just for the privileged. The UBV's whole ethos is radically different to the country's private universities. ""We wanted to revise the social relevance of degrees and offer new programmes, programmes that were innovative and adapted to the country,"" according to Maria Ejilda Castellano, rector of the UBV, speaking in 2004. ""We wanted to change the nature of technical education: to make it less fragmented, to involve the student in practice from the beginning, and to involve the student in projects from the start, rather than to fill a student with years of reading before they got a chance to actually do something, which was the model until then."" These are ideas that universities here could do well with adopting. Breaking away from the traditional system of creating ""depoliticised professionals"", courses at the UBV stress social responsibility. Some 77% of the students are from poor backgrounds, and so the students are provided with food, healthcare and transport - and of course, there are no fees As for Venezuelan students themselves, after several attempts to organise on a national level, the Frente Francisco Miranda (FFM) was formed in 2003, which has since become the largest youth-based organisation in the country. Although not strictly speaking a student organisation, many of its members are indeed students, and its mission is for the most an educational one - it plays an important role in Misión Ribas, the government's programme for adults who have dropped out of high school, and Misión Sucre , which aims to get people from poor backgrounds into university. Ronny Pante is the general coordinator of the Movimiento Estudiantil Integracionista (Integration Students Movement), an official student organization at the ""Simon Rodriguez"" National Experimental University (UNESR) in the capital of the southern State of Bolivar. For two years, from 2004-2005, he was the organisational and ideological education officer of the Frente Francisco Miranda in Bolivar, and for a year now he has been the general coordinator of the Office of Education Programmes (Misiones) in Ciudad Bolivar.

													Jeremy Dear","Jeremy Dear on behalf of the National Union of Journalists on motion 73. Brendan Barber opened congress by celebrating the visit of President Hugo Chavez to the UK and to Congress House . That visit, along many others by trade unionists, and community campaigners over the past 12 moths, was a sign of the importance which Venezuelan politicians, community organisations and trade unions attach to this movement’s support for the social and economic changes happening in Venezuela. And it was a proud moment for me, to stand before the Congress of Venezuela’s largest trade union confederation, the UNT, to deliver on the TUC’s behalf, a message of solidarity with Venezuela’s working people . Comrades, as a young trade union activist I recall reading the booklet “Nicaragua, the threat of good example”. It explained the social gains made in that country under the Sandinista government - in literacy, in education and in health and how, as a result of becoming a beacon for the people of other Latin American countries, it had also become a target for the US-backed Contras and a victim of economic sabotage. If that was the case with Nicaragua or Cuba as we have just heard, how much more so in Venezuela, which has reclaimed its oil, many of his industries, and much of its lands to benefit those forced into poverty, unemployment and landlessness by years of policies of IMF imposed austerity. No one believes that Venezuela, overnight, has become a paradise. No one believes that crime, transport and housing are not real issues. But let us also not believe the lies that this is an unpopular dictatorship. And let us too not underestimate, and let us celebrate the huge achievements that Venezuelan working people have made. The country declared free of illiteracy by UNESCO. More than 1.2 million people now have been given access to health care of which they were previously denied. They have built 657 new schools and eight new universities. Millions of hectares of land have been redistributed. But the social and economic revolution is about more than statistics. It is about the humans and the individuals in education for the fist time. Given the right to learning, the right to work with dignity, the right to basic health care, those free from illiteracy. The social and economic revolution has also given rise to new media, easing the control from millionaires who own so much of Venezuelan media, given rise to new unions, replacing the old corrupt unions with independent, militant and participative unions and given rise to debates and movements for workers control and community and democratic accountability. Hugo Chavez will go to the polls in December, backed by independent unions, health workers, teachers, community and youth organisations… in a fair election, he will win. But there is a threat. Not content with support for a failed coup or an economic sabotage, the new CIA mission in Cuba and Venezuela is already seeking to interfere in this election. Our principles demand we must support the Venezuelan trade unions and working people who demand nothing more than the right, free from interference, to determine their own future. There is a threat, but there is a force capable of undermining that threat, it is a force we call solidarity. Solidarity with the Venezuelan people, with independent trade unions - in support of their gains and in defence of their rights. We must build further solidarity, delivered by trade unionists and trade unions, to trade unionists and trade unions. Our motion welcomes the solidarity work being carried out by three solidarity organisations and supports all those campaigners that have taken this cause to all the trade union meetings, union conferences, community organisations and beyond. But between its lines it also expresses some despair and frustration. There are too many occasions when solidarity organisations have spent more time seeking to score points off each other or find arcane points of disagreement than delivering what the people in Venezuela really need, solidarity. It may satisfy some, but to the people of Venezuela is not only incomprehensible but potentially disastrous. Our motion is a plea for trade union unity to deliver greater trade union solidarity and for the TUC to help co-ordinate that work. We are asked to remit and we understand some of the concerns about how we have proposed that co-ordination work. We are not wedded to a single means but we believe that there must be action - we are implacable in recognising that in unity is greater strength and that in the face of the momentous challenges and the serious threats that Venezuelan working people face, the greatest strength possible is needed to defend the enormous gains that they have already made. On the basis that Sally [Hunt] has pledged that there will be further action to create that unity, we will remit.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela"," On Saturday, September 23, Venezuela's Foreign Affairs Minister Nicolás Maduro was taken into custody at JFK airport in New York as he was about to board a flight to Caracas. He was only released, an hour and a half later, after UN officials intervened. Hands Off Venezuela would like to protest in the strongest terms possible against this abuse, which is also in breach of international law. Nicolas Maduro was in the United States as part of the Venezuelan delegation to the United Nations 61 General Assembly. It is difficult not to see the behaviour of US officials as some sort of retaliation for president Chavez's strongly worded denunciation of the imperialist policies of the US administration. This is not the first time that Venezuelan officials have been subject to degrading and humilliating treatment in the US. Both the doctor and the head of security of Chavez's delegation to the UN were denied entry to the US and had to stay on their plane. This was a repeat of the situation the previous year when President Chavez attended the UN conference. More recently, military aviation staff at the Venezuelan purchase and liaison offices in Miami and Ohio, where subject to "" unfair, rude treatment "" at the hands of US security personnel. This unjustified harassment has clear political motives. The US administration does not like the Bolivarian Revolution and has done and will do all in its power to put an end to it and to the democratically elected government of President Chavez. We wish to convey our solidarity to Nicolas Maduro, and once again reiterate our protest against this abuse. London, September 25 ",NA,NA

													Morning Star"," SOLIDARITY campaigners picketed the Mexican embassy in London on Saturday to protest against the decision by the country's electoral tribunal to declare right-wing candidate Felipe Calderon the winner of July's tainted general election. Despite many documented allegations of fraud, including vote-rigging and ballot-dumping, the tribunal rejected the demands of opposition candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador — known by his initials AMLO — to order a full recount. Calderon ""officially"" won by just 0.6 per cent of the vote. Protesters chanted slogans such as ""AMLO won"" and ""down with electoral fraud"" outside the embassy, as speakers explained that the US administration will not tolerate a left-wing government on its own border. The solidarity action coincided with a ""national democratic convention"" in Mexico City's Zocalo Square by over a million supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador to debate their next move, at which they voted to form a ""parallel government of the streets."" A spokesman from Hands Off Venezuela, which organised the London protest, said: ""The situation in Mexico is very dangerous and the people there are refusing to accept this blatant robbery of their democratic rights. ""We call on Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to recognise this new popular parallel government of the streets, led by AMLO."" President Chavez has, so far, refused to recognise Mr Calderon's victory and has publicly accused the Mexican government of stealing the election. ",NA,NA

Luis Granados presented the event and gave a history of the Venezuela revolution. Julian Benson spoke on Oil nationalization and the benefits of a planned economy. Phil Goebel spoke on workers control and how it can be an alternative to capitalism. The event was well received and many insightful questions were asked. The second event was held at 6:00pm on the 8th and was co-hosted together with the Socialist Caucus. The event featured the Consulate of Venezuela and Cuba and featured a special guest (that even we were unaware of), a member of the national assembly of Venezuela! Unfortunately, there were many other events going on at the same time and the main convention ran on longer then scheduled so the turnout wasn't as large as the event deserved. However the member of the national assembly showed a lot of interest in the Hands off Venezuela table. Support for Venezuela is strong and growing in the NDP. Six different pro-Venezuela resolutions were submitted to the Convention and hundreds of delegates proudly wore ""Hands Off Venezuela"" stickers supplied by HOV activists. Unfortunately, none of the Venezuela resolutions made it to the floor of Convention due to the short amount of time being taken up with the debate over ""Troops Out"" of Afghanistan. The NDP has now adopted the position Chavez proposed back in 2001! The HOV info table was very successful and even became an unofficial hang-out spot for the NDP youth. The New Democratic Youth of Canada passed a resolution in support of HOV and were so enthusiastic about the campaign that they even protested the fact that youth sponsored resolutions such as HOV did not reach the floor for debate. NDP Leader Jack Layton has also expressed interest in visiting Hugo Chavez. All in all, the weekend was very important for Hands off Venezuela and the international solidarity movement.

													Hands Off Venezuela","More than 120 people packed the Latin America fringe meeting at the TUC on Monday, September 11. The meeting had been organised by the TUC General Council, together with a number of solidarity campaigns (Cuba Solidarity Campaign, Justice for Colombia, Hands Off Venezuela and VICUK), and sponsored by Thompson's solicitors. As we were going into the meeting there was a lively picket outside the Grand Hotel in Brighton, with trade union activists shouting ""Hands Off! Hands Off!"" When we asked what they were protesting about we found out they were RMT activists, including general secretary Bob Crow, fighting against the privatisation of the East London Line which has been proposed by Transport for London and London Mayor Ken Livingstone. The Latin America meeting was chaired by a Sally Hunt, a representative of the TUC General Council, which shows the importance that was given to this meeting. She expressed the will of the TUC to build ""lasting relations with our trade union comrades in Venezuela"". After a short introduction, we were shown a video of the Trade Unions with Cuba Conference which had taken place in London earlier in the year. This was followed by a speech by Zelmys Rodriguez, the First Secretary of the Cuban embassy in Britain. She explained that Cuba was so dangerous ""because of the example it provides of a new society ... because we export our doctors and teachers around the world"" and referring to Mission Milagro she added: ""we are dangerous because we give light to the blind people."" She then denounced the double standards of the US administration regarding the struggle against terrorism, explaining how Washington harbours and protects self-confessed terrorists like Posada Carrilles and Orland Bosch, while it jails the Cuban Miami Five for the crime of having exposed the terrorist activities of the Cuban mafia in Miami. Next to speak was Rafael ChachÃ³n from Venezuela, who is a leading member of the Bolivarian Workers' Front tendency of the UNT, and currently has a position in the Ministry of Education. First of all, he detailed the achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution in the fields of education and healthcare. He then explained the origins of the UNT which was born out of the struggle against the bosses' lock-out in December 2002 (supported by the old CTV bureaucracy). He said that ""elements of the capitalist state still remain"" and that the ""UNT must become a revolutionary trade union"". ChacÃ³n insisted that the December 3 rd presidential elections were in fact ""not a struggle against internal opposition but a struggle against Bush"". He also explained the seven strategic lines defended by President Chavez for his next term of office, including the building of ""socialist morals in the struggle against bureaucracy and corruption"" and the building of ""a socialist economy"". He ended his speech by joking that in his next visit to Britain he would be coming from a ""socialist Venezuela"" which was received by applause from the audience. Next to speak was Aidee Moreno, from the Human Rights Department of Colombia´s agricultural workers' union FENSUAGRO. In a moving speech she explained how trade unionists in Colombia are ""a target for the military and are subject to repression by the government and the armed forces"". Since president Uribe came to power ""more than 500 trade union activists have been killed"" she explained. Impunity is one of the main problems and this was being made worse by a new law introduced by Uribe. She insisted that British trade unionists must fight to put an end to the military aid that the British government gives to Colombia. Aidee finished her intervention by making an appeal to British trade union activists ""to remain vigilant to defend Colombian trade union activists"". Aidee was followed by a brief speech by Colin Burgon MP, who has always been active in Parliament on the issue of Cuba and more recently also on Venezuela. During the questions session, Jorge Martin, from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, spoke briefly. He asked ChacÃ³n about the experiences of workers' control and participation which are taking place in Venezuela and specifically mentioned Alcasa and the occupied factories which were then expropriated and put under one form or another of workers' participation. Jorge also said that Chavez had opened the debate about socialism, ""after many years of demonisation after the fall of the Berlin Wall"", and how Chavez had stated clearly that ""Capitalism is not the answer, and that the way forward is socialism"". He added that ""we have a lot to learn in this respect"" and paraphrasing NATFHE´s John Wilkin speaking at the TUC the previous year, Jorge said ""we need a bit of that Bolivarianism in the British trade union movement"". This prompted a response by Jacobo Torres, also a leading member of the Venezuelan FBT who is now working in the Foreign Affairs Ministry. He stressed that we should not fall into the ""dangerous temptation to label our process or to apply recipes to it"". He added that, ""we cannot repeat the serious error of revolutionaries in other countries of mixing up our desires with the rhythm of the revolution"". He stressed that the question of socialism is not posed immediately in Venezuela, as we are still ""in a transitional phase"". Regarding workers' control he made it very clear that ""we cannot talk about workers' control in Venezuela, regardless of what some have been saying"" (in a clear reference to Jorge Martin's question). This issue, he said, is still the subject of a long debate amongst Venezuelan workers who have ""neither the culture nor the level of consciousness needed to implement workers' control"". What there is in Venezuela is a number of factories which were bankrupt and had been ""recovered by the state, following the rules in the constitution"", therefore there could be ""no talk of workers' control"", and above all there is ""no workers' control in any of the basic industries in Guayana, including Alcasa"". This was quite surprising, since in fact a form of workers' control does exist in factories like Inveval, Invepal and others. It might be called ""cogestiÃ³n"" (co-management), but what happens there is that the workers, through the workers', assembly have a decisive say in the running of the factory. In Alcasa, in fact, the workers do elect all managerial levels of the company (with the exception of the chairman), and these are subject to the right of recall (see for instance a BBC report on this: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4155936.stm ). What the intervention of Jacobo Torres clearly showed, however, was the existence of serious differences within the Bolivarian movement and within the trade union movement about the struggle for socialism and about the role of workers in it. There are those, in the reformist wing of the movement, that insist on the fact that private property must be respected, that the struggle is only against imperialism (at this stage), not against the local capitalists, and above all, that the workers do not have the necessary consciousness to exercise power directly (not even at factory level through workers' control). Because they do not like what is happening, they try to deny it is actually taking place, or in the case of the electricity company CADAFE, they block any attempts of the workers to exercise workers' control. This is quite dangerous because it can lead to demoralisation and apathy, something which would undermine the basis of support for the revolution. There are those, on the left, revolutionary wing of the movement who argue that only by decisively taking measures to complete the revolution, can this be defended in an effective way. The argument that the workers have no consciousness is so preposterous that it would not even merit an answer. It was the ordinary workers of the oil company PDVSA who took it over, saved it from the lock-out and sabotage of the counter-revolution, and ran it under workers' control for a few weeks, in December 2002. It was ordinary workingmen and women who came out en masse in April 2002 to defeat the coup against Chavez. If they can do that, surely they can run industry and society as a whole. As Colin Burgon said, there are many things British workers can learn from their Venezuelan brothers and sisters. The debates that are taking place within the Bolivarian revolution should also be brought here, because they affect the future of the revolution, in Venezuela and in Britain as well. At the end of the meeting there was a lot of interest in Hands Off Venezuela with many trade union activists leaving their contact details.",NA,NA

			Hands Off Venezuela’s TUC Fringe Meeting – “Workers’ Control in Venezuela”",2006-09-14T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Rodrigo Trompiz","After the screening of the excellent short documentary “Venezuela Today, the World Tomorrow?”, Jorge MartÃ­n, international secretary of the HOV campaign, was next to speak. Jorge pointed out that oil workers in Venezuela were somewhat different to other sectors since they had higher wages and better benefits, and were fed the idea that they were separate. But despite this, during the lockout, they managed to take over the running of this highly complex industry. The workers’ struggle is linked to the struggle against imperialism, showing that there is no need for bosses. Workers control had mainly been limited to bankrupt factories where workers have taken over and the plants have been expropriated by the state. The first such case was the paper mill Venepal (now Invepal) which was taken over for 3 months after it was declared bankrupt in 2005. It was expropriated under “co-management”, with the workers owning 49% of the factory and the state 51%. However, the workers have a majority on the board, and also have the decisive vote. This first expropriation has led to around 20 more, including 2 last week. At Invepal, many mistakes have been made following the workers takeover, but the workers moved quickly to solve the issue – they kicked out the management who had originally led the struggle but were now causing problems. This shows how the workers can solve their own problems. The main difference in Venezuela is that the legal framework supports such activities, whereas in other countries workers face repression for carrying out these acts. Jorge ended by highlighting that although there are lots of contradictions in the worker control process, it is nevertheless an inspiration to workers everywhere. For more information on the TUC delegation to Venezuela, and a review of the documentary, please see the latest issue of the Hands Off Venezuela magazine, available now.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela (Canada)"," As part of an international day of action, the Hands Off Venezuela campaign hosted successful events in four Canadian cities to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of the Bolivarian referendum victory on 15 August. Over 100 people turned up in Toronto to celebrate the anti-imperialist victory in 2004. The evening featured musical performances and spoken word by a number of local artists, in addition to a visiting Cuban folk group. The consul-generals of Venezuela and Cuba were also in attendance to offer their greetings and gratitude. Hands Off Venezuela helped to organize the successful event, in addition to the ""Venezuela We Are With You"" coalition and the Bolivarian Circles ""Louis Riel"" and ""Manuelita Sáenz"". In Vancouver, over 25 people gathered in Vancouver's Chilean Co-op to view the Canadian premiere of ""The Old Man and Jesus: Prophets of Rebellion"", in celebration of the 15 August international day of solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. Following two Chavistas through their day-to-day lives in Caracas, the film showed the great progress of the revolutionary process unfolding in Venezuela, while also highlighting its inability to solve many of the fundamental problems of Venezuelan society, problems caused by the nature of the capitalist system. The film was enthusiastically received by those in attendance, who were inspired to participate in a discussion after the film. The future of the Bolivarian Revolution, as well as the growing movement seeking to overturn the fraudulent election in Mexico, were also discussed as activists came up with ways to participate in those struggles from Canada. Smaller events were also held in Calgary and Whitehorse, each attended by about 20 people. In total, the Hands Off Venezuela campaign was able to attract Venezuela solidarity activists from all corners of Canada to celebrate a key victory of the Bolivarian Revolution. Hands Off Venezuela was also invited to participate in the annual Labour Day parade in Hamilton on 4 September. HOV held a prominent spot near the head of the parade as over 5,000 marched through the streets of downtown Hamilton. Afterwards, many trade unionists approached the HOV stall to inquire about the campaign and about events in Venezuela. Of particular interest were materials on workers' control and the nationalization of Venezuelan factories.

													Hands Off Venezuela Canada"," The Hands Off Venezuela campaign is helping to organize a series of events across Canada, in conjunction with events around the world, to celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the referendum victory. Venezuela Rising On August 15, 2004, the Venezuelan rich - with aid from the US and Canadian governments - tried to bring down the Chavez government through a recall referendum. The Venezuelan people massively mobilized to defeat the recall. Join us on the second anniversary of the referendum in celebration of the victory of the Venezuelan people -- part of an international day of action.

Join us to celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the referendum victory! ""The Old Man and Jesus: Prophets of Rebellion"" is a new documentary film by Venezuelan film maker Marcelo Andrade (of the Calle y Media collective), whose ""Venezuela Bolivariana"" has opened the eyes of thousands of people to the reality and importance of the Venezuelan Revolution. This 70 minute film offers a unique perspective on the Bolivarian revolutionary process: it follows the lives of two men who live on the streets of Caracas in the middle of the bosses' oil industry lockout in late 2002. The wisdom of the Old Man and the explosive passion of Jesus give a direct account of the commitment to liberation that grows from the Venezuelan people. This film is a documented-prophecy of the rebellion that minute-to-minute is silently planned below the bridges and sewers of a world that sooner or later will rise for justice.

			Belgian Socialist TUC decides to establish links with the UNT",2006-08-14T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Belgium"," Two union branches affiliated to the Hands off Venezuela campaign in the Belgian socialist union ABVV/FGTB succeeded in harnessing some important support for a motion of solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela. This motion also asked for the recognition of the new trade union movement UNT. Those union branches were the public service union (ACOD) in the province of Limburg and the Antwerp branch of the Algemene Centrale, a union organising workers especially in the oil, chemical and building industry. By presenting this motion they wanted to open the discussion in the wider trade union movement on the developments in Latin America. Not accidentally those unions presenting the motion have already an important record in launching international solidarity campaigns amongst their members (on Colombia, Cuba, Palestine, Iraq etc.). These unions are also amongst the most combative unions when it comes to defending the rights of their members, as they have shown in the two general strikes in October last year in their struggle against the reform of the early retirement system. Rapidly they gained support for the motion. It was passed by the national union Algemene Centrale/Centrale Générale (the second biggest union within the ABVV/FGTB), and also by the provincial body of ABVV Limburg and the whole public service union ACOD in the Flemish region. Furthermore, the motion was widely circulated in other areas of the union in Brussels, Charleroi, Liège, and Verviers. However, as soon as the motion reached the national level of the socialist union, some opposition started to appear. In their refusal to accept the motion some national union leaders repeated the slanders of the ICFTU associate in Venezuela and the CTV union which took an active part in the 2002 coup against Chavez. This meant that the motion did not get through the resolution commission and was not presented at the Congress. Instead a paragraph was added in the document on international trade union rights, explaining that the union was waiting for a new official report of the ICFTU. Meanwhile it expressed its support for the ""Venezuelan comrades in their struggle for free and independent unionism"". It was not explicitly mentioned who the Venezuelan comrades were but there was little doubt the authors of this paragraph were thinking of the CTV... Despite this, the national leadership had to partially retreat. Eric Lambert spoke for the Algemene Centrale Antwerpen-Waasland at the ABVV/FGTB congress (read his intervention below). After this intervention, the national trade union secretary, Daniel Vandael, promised in his reply that the ABVV/FGTB was going to establish contact with the UNT in Venezuela. This is clearly an important opening in the union. The chairman of the Antwerp region of the Algemene Centrale, Bruno Verlaeckt, commented afterwards: ""Now we need a period of study and information on the situation in Venezuela in our union. This can of course not be limited to the upper ranks of the union but must reach the rank and file activists"". ""We have already got an ongoing project of solidarity with Colombia. But if you say that Colombia is an example of what must not be done, you must also be able to tell people how we see things changing. Our basic concept of trade unionism is that we want the national resources of a country being used to fulfil the social needs of the people. This basic concept is being put into practice in Venezuela."" Building on this breakthrough, the Hands off Venezuela campaign has taken the initiative for a national day of solidarity in December. Different organisations have already expressed their support in organising this important event. Plans are also being worked out to have someone from the UNT to come to Belgium to meet the trade union activists and the solidarity movement. Hands off Venezuela - Belgium The contribution below was put forward at the congress by Eric Lambert of the socialist union in the oil refinery Total in Antwerp. Three years ago Jorge Martin, the international secretary of HOV, explained to this trade union branch the real situation of the Venezuelan Revolution and the Labour Movement. ""At Algemene Centrale we have a project of solidarity with the Colombian union of oil workers. Our branch, the branch of Antwerpen-Waasland, deducts 5 eurocent each month from the subs of each member to finance the trade union school of Fensuargo, union of agricultural labourers. Thus we are very happy with the resolution on Colombia. Different shop stewards of our union have gone to Colombia, which is, as you all know, the most dangerous place on earth for trade unionists. We have spoken there with women whose husbands have been killed and with men whose brothers have been kidnapped, for the sole and only reason of being trade unionists. In Colombia things are simple: the natural resources are shared between the multinationals and the landowners. The population lives in poverty: more than 60 % of the population lives below the poverty line. We have read in Trends a few weeks ago that Colombia is the last hope for the North American and European multinationals. In the last years we have witnessed the election, in different countries of Latin America, of leaders who propose another model: they want to use the wealth coming from the natural resources of the country to finance social programs, in other words, oil for education, housing and health. Hugo Chavez, the democratically elected president of Venezuela, is literally the motor of this movement, who inspires this process but more importantly gives hope to many developing countries, as well as to the trade unionists in Colombia. That is why we want to explicitly congratulate the government of Chavez for its social programs in this resolution. The United Nations has concluded that the alphabetisation programs have now taught the overwhelming majority of the Venezuelans to read and write. Thanks to the health programs millions of poor people have now access to medical aid in their neighbourhoods. It is evident that Chavez is a thorn in the side of the ruling class both in Venezuela and in other countries. After the coup d'état against Chavez in 2002, the bosses' organisation of Venezuela even organised a strike against the regime with the aim of forcing Chavez to resign. The union which is recognised by the ICFTU and also by ABVV-FGTB supported this bosses' strike against Chavez. Thanks to the effort of many rank and file trade unionists many factories were kept open and continued to function under their own supervision. The lock-out was defeated. That is why we ask to include in the resolution that ABVV-FGTB, just as the British TUC did, establish links with the UNT and we ask the international unions affiliated to the ICFTU to do the same. The UNT is a relatively new union in Venezuela which has split from the corrupt CTV but which already counts more than 1 million members who joined over the last three years. To conclude, we ask the Congress to express in this resolution its indignation against the hostile declarations of the Bush government against the government of Venezuela and we condemn the intervention in the internal affairs of Venezuela. We remember with horror Pinochet who in Chile, with the help of the United States, suppressed the socialist project of president Allende in blood. Will we let this happen a second time?"" ",NA,NA

Many books, DVDs and posters were sold, with lots of people also signing up for more information. The concert itself was a success, despite being scaled down after several acts pulled out. It began with a speech from Mayor Ken Livingstone who highlighted the positive, radical changes in Venezuela, and the attempts by US imperialism to defeat the revolution. Greater Caracas Mayor Juan Barreto was due to speak, but owing to recent political events in Caracas, was forced to stay in Venezuela. All in all a very successful event for Hands Off Venezuela!

			300 gather in Brighton to see The Revolution Will Not be Televised",2006-06-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ann Hallam"," A packed audience of 300 at the Duke of York's Cinema in Brighton watched 'The Revolution Will Not be Televised' on June 14th and afterwards 70 people crammed into a meeting room above a pub to hear Jorge Martin speak on the situation in Venezuela now and the hopes and challenges for the future. The film still has the power to keep audiences on the edge of their seats even after several viewings, and especially for those in the audience who had never seen it before it was a stirring experience. The discussion afterwards was lively - Jorge gave a very detailed and thorough account of the developments Chavez is spearheading to consolidate the Revolution and the tangible changes in education, health and employment for the people previously marginalised by right wing governments. He also spoke about the international dimension of the Revolution, the cooperation on trade and health and social programmes with Cuba, and the spread in Latin America of resistance to the United States' and its neoliberal policies. There was some dissent from anti-Chavez Venezuelans in the audience who raised the issue of Chavez's autocratic tendencies - a smear generated and circulated by elements of the press in this country - but the audience, many of them new to the issues raised, were overwhelmingly supportive of the Venezuelan Revolution, and fascinated by the tactics Chavez has taken and will have to take to overcome the threat of US intervention. The organisers were very pleasantly surprised by the huge response to the event - about 40 people signed up to receive regular news bulletins on Venezuela - and we hope to build on this success to develop our campaign in Brighton.

			An evening with Hugo Chavez",2006-07-13T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Kay Shelley - The Journalist"," The Journalist , the monthly magazine of the National Union of Journalists, covered Hugo Chavez' visit to London and mentioned its support for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Kay Shelley joined the throng to find out why the leader of Venezuela was the hottest media ticket in town. Everybody who was anybody wanted to squash into London's Camden Centre near King's Cross to hear the President of Venezuela in person — Gareth Peirce, Bianca Jagger, Jon Snow, Jeremy Dear. But you don't have to be a human rights lawyer, a Nicaraguan celebrity, a Channel 4 jour­nalist or even a trade union leader to warm to Hugo Chavez. Affable, chatty, jokey and touchy-feely - he patted his host Ken Livingstone so often that the Mayor of London started to look like a tomato - Hugo Chavez dominated the platform at the Camden Centre where a hastily convened public meeting had attracted 5,000 applicants for fewer than 1,000 seats. Despite tight security, there was a party atmosphere, as musicians, leafletters and stallholders chanted his name, waved banners, said they loved him. In his slightly awkward English, he told them he loved them back. And why not? A man who uses oil revenues to help the poor at home and abroad, achieves 100 per cent literacy in less than ten years, and was saved from a US-backed coup by his popularity, has got to care about people. The chance to hear him speak in person during his private visit to London seemed too good to miss. Anyone who thumbs his nose at Bush can't be all bad, but what was the truth about the man who provokes diatribes in some newspapers and profound admiration in others? Dodging back and forth over a huge range of topics, conveyed by earphone translation from Spanish to English, he repeatedly engaged conversationally with his audience, joking about his enemies, combining entertainment with serious talk of democracy. If he was dissembling, he was doing it in a superbly clever way. Humanity needed socialism, he said. Perhaps we should all wear badges saying: ""I'm a socialist - touch me, and I'll infect you!"" We were charmed by his charisma. My only problem was that he can talk for longer than Ken Dodd (three and a half hours, with one glass of water and no toilet break). Was he really a mate of Saddam Hussein? He quickly nailed that one, put about when he was meeting successive world leaders in his role as chair of OPEC. Was he close friends with Castro? Well, of course, because they're both dedicated to raising standards and fighting the same imperialist power. Chavez is no fool. At least three times he mentioned the possibility of assassination by one of his many enemies. No-one knows how long he will survive. Which is why the occasion was not only very important to history, but probably unique. We may not see his like again. Something to tell the grand­children. And a cause for regret that some journalists may be contributing to his demise. Funny, isn't it, how South American dictators get away with murder for years, but along comes a democrat and swathes of the press savage him. The NUJ'S recent annual delegate meeting agreed to support the Hands off Venezuela campaign and to build links with trade unions in the country. Book Branch's Sylvia Courtnage told delegates the government was transforming workers' lives with improvements such as the eradication of illiteracy. ""The US hates what is happening there,"" she said. ""The Venezuelan people are preparing a defence against threats from Bush and Condoleezza Rice."" ",NA,NA

													VHeadline.com","Speech by the Venezuelan Embassy's Cultural Attache on the occasion of the Rise Festival in London on July 8, 2006 London Mayor Ken Livingstone passes the microphone to Venezuelan Cultural attache Zuleiva Vivas I want to thank Mr. Ken Livingstone and his team members for their invitation to speak at this event on behalf of the people of Venezuelan. I want very specially to offer enormous thanks and a warm welcome to everyone on behalf of President Hugo Chavez, who on his recent visit to London, enjoyed the hospitality of Londoners thanks to an invitation from the Mayor of this city. It is with pleasure that I record the words of our President Hugo Chavez at the 7th Summit of the African Union in The Gambia a week ago, where Chavez gave due tribute to Mother Africa and remarked that Latin Americans and Caribbeans are a mixture of Africans, Amerindians and Europeans. Latin Americans and Caribbeans are not European nor are they northern Americans ... each day we are all the more conscious of our African and Amerindian roots.. Our people's history began with the Quechuan, Aymara, Inca, Aztec and Mayan civilizations, long before the arrival of the Conquistadores. Only after that came the mix with the Africans and the Spanish that has led to this beautiful mixture (of cultural heritages) that we are today. However our ""mother"" is Africa and pre-Hispanic These are the origins that predominate and appears in the faces and the smiles of our peoples. In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela we believe in the equality of all men and women ... it is what we proclaimed and what we practice, since we have delved deeply into rescuing our own roots that have filled America ... roots had been forgotten for years, postponed, lethargic, disdained. Some in my country have thought to say that our racial mixture preserves us from the racism. How mistaken they are! Very much on the contrary, racial and class differences in Venezuela have been part of our history like a subterranean and murky river that was not spoken of, where the terrible exclusion of the poor persons was a sunless truth, where secular aggression of our native peoples, that shame, was concealed by hypocrisy and lies. In Venezuela there has been an awakening of consciences where we strive each day for equality and social security, without distinction, that's why each document is sealed with the sentence: ""Venezuela is for everyone."" After 300 years of colonialism of independent revolution a has taken flame in America, from the early days of the 19th century the new republics of Latin American and the Caribbean began to emerge. The second resurgence (of the flame) came in the 20th century with the birth of African republics. Now, our President Chavez says, we must breathe life into a third surge where we must all go forward with the same magic, the same music and with the same hope. Only united, without any form of discrimination, with brotherhood, will we be able to change the world ... we will achieve what Simon Bolivar, our Liberator, called ""the equilibrium of the Universe"" ... a multi-polar world ... a world where we all may live in freedom, equality and peace.

													Hands Off Venezuela Greece"," On Monday, July 10, the Greek committee of the ""Hands Off Venezuela!"" campaign organised an open meeting on the subject of ""Radicalisation in Latin America"". The speakers at the open meeting were Lydia Gonzalez, the consul of the Cuban embassy in Athens, Maria Ines Fonceca, the consul of the Venezuelan embassy, Kostas Athanasiou from the Greek Social Forum and Evi Tounda, a representative of the Greek committee of HOV and of the Marxist Tendency and paper ""Marxistiki Foni"". The meeting was held in the area of Nea Philadelfia, in the northwest of Athens. One hundred people attended the meeting. Among them were members and political cadres of PASOK and Synaspismos, young militants of the KKE and other left workers and young people that are keen to know what is happening in Latin America. In her speech Evi Tounda emphasized at the role of the working class in the turn to the left throughout the whole of Latin America and also underlined the key role of the Bolivarian revolution in this turn. She also analysed the situation in Bolivia and in Ecuador, and she explained that the only way of building a firm and solid unity of Latin America is through the struggle for a socialist Federation. Lindia Gonzalez explained the details of how ALBA [Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas] was created and also outlined the effect that the Cuban revolution has in the struggle of the Latin-American masses against imperialism. Maria Ines Fonseca underlined the important steps that the Bolivarian revolution has taken against poverty and social inequalities in Venezuela, and also congratulated the members of the Greek HOV campaign for their systematic work of spreading the revolutionary Bolivarian spirit among the Greek workers and youth. The last speaker Kostas Athanasiou stressed the developments in Mexico by explaining how the Mexican ruling elite had ""cooked"" the results of the presidential elections and he also explained that the movement of the masses is the real cause of the electoral victories of the Left all over Latin America. After the speeches the people watched ""The revolution will not be televised"", a film about the dramatic events around the 2002 coup against Chavez when the masses stopped the reactionaries through immediate spontaneous action. At the end of the meeting many people left their addresses expressing the wish to participate actively in HOV and they bought material and the DVDs of HOV. This successful open meeting was further proof that the HOV Campaign is now established and well known in Greece. ",NA,NA

			Jeremy Dear on the TUC delegation to Venezuela",2006-06-17T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Jeremy Dear - www.handsoffvenezuela.org"," National Union of Journalists general secretary Jeremy Dear gave a debriefing to solidarity activists , on Wednesday June 14 2006 at the union's headquarters in London, of the first official TUC delegation to Venezuela. This is the full text of his speech, which was followed by a question and answer session. See also a video of the event. Jeremy Dear: Thank you for the opportunity to report back. There is no official report from the delegation as of yet, it has to go to the TUC general council and the executive. So these are, in effect, my observations of the delegation. The original purpose of the delegation was as a fact-finding mission when it was set up. Then, in between time, the TUC became the first union federation in Europe to pass a resolution of solidarity and therefore it became both fact-finding and a solidarity mission. I think that was quite important in terms of the actual meetings that we did. For those of us who hadn't been to Venezuela before, I think there was some sense of trepidation as to what we might find. Clearly, we know the statistics. We have UNESCO declaring Venezuela free of illiteracy, we have the huge advances that have been made in terms of addressing infant mortality, about huge rises in life expectancy, about the people who have been brought into education, the people who have been brought in with coverage of health, the 1.2 million people originally denied care now being treated in health centres and so on and so forth. Behind those statistics, what we didn't know was what the situation on the ground was and how those statistics bore out in reality. Behind every one of those statistics there are human stories. I think what is most powerful about when you visit countries in a revolutionary process, like this, or in a situation where there is a revolutionary process is that it is the human stories that confirm to you the statistics and the evidence that you get from books and magazines and so on. I think that is what is particularly inspiring about the situation in Venezuela is the participation of people in this revolutionary process. It is not just a process driven from the top. It is not just a process driven by a small number of people, it is a process in which millions of people are engaged, right across the board and in many different ways. Within that there are people who would describe themselves as liberals, people who would describe themselves primarily as Catholics, people who describe themselves primarily as socialists, as Marxists and so on. But it is a genuinely revolutionary process that is happening there. It is not, as i say, purely driven by people at the top. I think that we saw that by being able to visit a whole number of the different kinds of projects, a number of different factories that have been occupied, the oil refinery that was at the centre of the oil strike and so on. We see it none more so than in the UNT congress, which was quite a remarkable event, but which i'll come back to. Just to give some idea of some of the places we visited and some of what we saw, one day, driving through the centre of Caracas, we saw this queue of people lined up and it went on for more than a kilometre. We couldn't work out what they might be queueing for. So we followed this snaking line through all the streets to where the front of the queue was. It was one of the new adult education centres, effectively. It was a registration day for people to sign up for education. We talked to people in the queue about, for them, the first opportunity they'd ever had to learn a whole range of different skills and different subjects that were on offer there. There were people in their 70s and their 80s and 90s who were talking about, for the first time in their life, they had opportunities that they never had before. That sent a very powerful message about the role of education in that revolutionary process as well. I think that the same is true of health. We went to one of the new health centres in Caracas. Again, queues of people coming, queueing before it opened. There's a thousand people being seen each week in this one health centre, with specialist equipment, which would put parts of our NHS to shame. And the cleanliness and the openness and the facilities that were available there. We had someone on the delegation who was a health specialist here and who represents NHS workers and who was quite jealous of what they were seeing in terms of up-to-date equipment. So we're not just talking here about doctors going in to poor neighbourhoods and kind of dispensing a few aspirins. We are talking about high-tech - in some cases - health centres that are bringing millions of people into, or making available to millions of people, health-care that was previously denied to them. We also were able to visit some of the workers' co-operatives that have been set up. Not the factories that have been taken over, the workers' co-operatives set up specifically for the purpose of creating jobs in some of the poor neighbourhoods and trying to give people from those neighbourhoods opportunities to learn skills as well as be in employment that pays much better than the kind of employment that they'd been in previously. Within those there was again some real advances that we were able to see. There was one other initiative that was quite remarkable. It was a supermarket in between these different factories, a clothing factory and a co-operative making shoes. They were actually making steel toes-capped boots for workers in some of the heavy industries, who up until now had had to simply go in with their ordinary shoes and this was part of a drive to improve health and safety in a number of the factories as well. We went to this supermarket and all these prices in the supermarket were between half and two-thirds of what they were in other supermarkets and the reason for this was that they had effectively cut out the middle man. There was nobody taking profits from it, there was no companies taking profits from it. It was simply being reinvested back in buying produce. They also had what was, effectively, their own brand stuff. Printed on the front of every one of the packets there was one of the clauses from the new constitution. So not only were you buying cheap pasta or cheap rice or cheap essentials to enable you to have a better standard of living and a better health, but actually on the front of every one of the packets was a clause from the constitution telling you your rights. Including one of them - we went hunting round the supermarket looking for the ones with the clauses of the constitution we really wanted, including the one about the right of recall of the president and the referendum. So here they are, these great ""dictators,"" Chávez and his ""dictatorial"" government, sponsoring these workers' co-operatives and supermarkets providing produce that actually have on it reminders to people that they have the right to have a referendum to recall the president! We also had the opportunity to see some, although not enough, of the new media. We were given a pamphlet by people of the National Assembly detailing more that 200 new ""alternative"" media outlets that had been created in the past few years, from TV stations to magazines to newspapers to online services. Really destroying this idea that there is this huge wave of media repression, which again we've seen repeated in the British media around the release of the Secuestro Express, the film, talking about how they're trying to clamp down on everything, close everything down in Venezuela. Well, far from it. What we had seen was, not only is 95% of the media still in private hands there but some 200 odd community projects, alternative media projects, have been established to try to counter some of the anti-Chávez propaganda that comes from other parts of the media. So, again destroying some of those myths. As I was saying, I think one of the most inspiring parts was seeing the development within the trade union movement. Because it was a fact-finding mission and because the CTV are the official union affiliated to the ILO, we agreed that we would meet with them. We would be obviously with the UNT and I think that just meeting them was so instrumental in showing the difference between these organisations. We went to the CTV headquarters, most of which is now empty, pretty much in darkness, yellowed posters on the wall. We went into this room and met a group of men sat round a black reflective table. It was like a scene out of Reservoir Dogs. We all kind of stepped back, looked behind us. We met with Manuel Cova, who, as people will know, was heavily involved in the coup against Chávez, he's pictured in the palace sitting in one of the chairs with all the other gangsters involved in the coup. So we said to him: ""Why were the CTV involved in the coup?"" He looked affronted that we could say anything and he denied that they were involved in the coup and he denied that he personally was involved in the coup. So we produced photos of him sat in the palace and said: ""That's you, isn't it? And this was the coup."" He went: ""Ah, now I see the confusion. This wasn't a coup, it was a popular uprising against President Chávez."" That is the way that they justify their participation in the coup, by saying that it was a popular uprising. To be honest, while we were there, the phone never rang, nobody ever came into the building. We left there and we went across town to the UNT headquarters. Brightly painted. We met with all the different factions of the executive round the table, people coming in all the time, most of them were on two mobile phones at once. There was activity everywhere happening. I know that they were in the build up to the UNT congress, but just that one kind of very visual perception of the differences showed that the opposition, certainly the opposition in the trade union movement, have no forces. Those forces that they have are not from the workers in the factories, are not from the working people, but from the elite. When we then went to the UNT congress on the Friday, we spent about the first three hours of the congress reading out socialist and Bolivarian and solidarity greetings from virtually every workplace in the whole of Venezuela. It was a slightly laborious but inspiring process. You can't quite imagine the TUC conference saying: ""And the people who work at Tesco in Hither Green would like to send socialist and Bolivarian greetings to the TUC."" Every time there was one of these, everyone stood up on the chairs and cheered. The cheering went on for about five minutes after every one, until everyone calmed them down. Then the next one was read out. Then they invited the various international solidarity delegates to speak. We didn't know this was going to happen. At this point we got about 60 seconds notice. They went: ""And the first one will be Jeremy Dear on behalf of the TUC,"" so I went up there and Jordi was there and came with me to translate. To be honest, such was the mood there that you could've said: ""I just went to Tescos"" and they would've been on their chairs cheering. It was that kind of fervour, a sense that they were creating something new. People talked all the time about putting that slogan that we all use, ""Another world is possible,"" about putting it into practice. And there were all kinds of ideas. There were good and bad ideas, there were all kinds of different factions involved, all kinds of differences about the way forward, about whether there should be elections now or they should get Chávez elected first and then have their own elections. What was clear from everybody was their absolute support for the revolutionary process that is happening. The UNT is growing at a huge rate. One of the reasons that the conference was delayed was because there were so many new union branches that have been formed in the run up to the congress, people who have moved from the CTV to the UNT, that they actually had a huge struggle with the registration process of delegates. Something like 2,500 delegates were registered for it. Again, we got a very clear perception of the difference between the old trade unionism and the old regime and what is happening there now. I think also that what is important, though, is that it's absolutely vital that we build solidarity with the trade unions, that we build solidarity with the revolutionary process, that we offer support to those who are seeking to build this socialism of the 21st century. But that we also recognise, as they do, that there are issues to be addressed. Not everything in Venezuela is a paradise. Crime is certainly a huge issue that needs to be addressed. When we met with Chávez we talked to him about this and he admitted that it is something that they still need to be able to tackle, because it is something that can undermine the positive aspects of the revolution, if crime is allowed to get out of control, or if it is perceived even to be out of control. Transport is another issue, particularly in Caracas, in which it can take a long time to get anywhere across the city. We saw one of the greatest pieces of graffiti that we've seen anywhere. We were stuck in the middle of a traffic jam in searing heat, with everyone hooting their horns, and someone had graffitied on the side of a building: ""The people who control the roads are employed by the CIA."" It was kind of a flippant comment, but actually it showed the potential to undermine the process by some of what might be considered to be the most basic issues that also have to be addressed. The other huge issue that all the ministers we spoke to, the trade unions and Chávez himself admits, is the question of housing. There are millions of people who still live in incredibly poor conditions. They know that there is a race against time to use the money to build new houses and there are signs all over the country of new houses being built and so on. But that is a process that obviously needs to continue and needs to be developed. We asked them what it is that they need from us, in terms of solidarity, because I think that it was important that they could tell us. They said that the first thing is help with winning the election. Without winning the election then of course the whole process goes potentially into reverse. There are some very important issues about the election. When we met with the CTV, we said to them, did they believe in democracy and they said yes they did. And we said, did they believe in voting and elections and so on. And they said yes, they did. We asked them whether or not they would be encouraging their members to vote in the election in December and they said no they wouldn't. But they weren't boycotting the elections, they were just not going to encourage anybody to vote in the elections. We asked them what the difference was and frankly they couldn't answer. But we already know what the scenario will be. In the run-up to the election the opposition will scream ""foul"" that some rules have been changed, or the electoral commission will fail to register so and so, and they will use that as an excuse not to take part in the elections. Then, when Chávez is re-elected, they will say, well it was a fraudulent election and they will use that as the excuse in order to take further action, or try renewed action against Chávez. Because they know that they cannot win the popular vote they will resort to the tactics that they have tried in the past. People there are very aware of this as a danger, which is why, around the time of the election, they want as much international solidarity and as many people in Venezuela to help out as they can possibly get. I think one of the things that came up time and time again with people from the UNT that also needs to happen is that they really have to address the question of workers' control. There are inspiring stories of the factories that have been taken over, but they are small in number and there are many others who want the same to be happening in their companies. There are many trade union branches which would like to see this process extended, speeded up and links made between the various factories which are under co-management or workers' control and so on. That came across as a potential running sore between the most progressive of the trade unionists and the Labour Ministry and people we spoke to in those area. Now, hopefully, that will not develop as a dispute between them, but I think, clearly there is a certain period of time that they will give the Chávez government to be able to deliver on this. If they don't, it's quite clear - certainly in some areas - that the trade unions themselves will take action to take over the factories or the workplaces in which they are. There is a clear desire to extend and deepen that workers' control and genuine workers' co-management. The other thing that they really wanted us to talk about was how we address the perception in the outside world that Chávez is a dictator who's centralising power and represses the media and so on. That's where we had the discussion with President Chávez himself and with some other people there about what we can do to try to establish some kind of pan-European campaign that helps to tackle those perceptions and helps to make available real information about what is going on in Venezuela, particularly from the position of my own union. That's a very important thing that we can do. We've certainly put down some plans about helping journalistic exchanges, about building contacts. I understand that last weekend there was a meeting of Bolivarian journalists to establish a new Bolivarian journalist organisation and that that would give us links to a new group of journalists who we've not been able to contact before, who we can put in touch with journalists here. We have to be much more upfront about taking on the kind of media coverage that we saw during President Chávez's visit to London, the kind of Daily Mail line about how he's the Taliban-loving, drug-running dictator of Latin America. I know that Rob, on behalf of Hands Off Venezuela, made a complaint about some of the press coverage that there was. It is very important that we try to tackle some of those issues in a much more active way. I'm talking within the NUJ about how we might be able to help build alongside Hands Off Venezuela, how to begin to tackle some of those issues in a much more concerted way than we have done up to now. What they said was that the best thing that we could do was to build the socialism of the 21st century in Britain. I told them that we'd be delighted to take that on as a major project for the coming years, but actually what they want in many cases is an exchange of what they mean by socialism of the 21st century, because it is a slogan which is used, but which is also actually a living debate, on the streets, in the workplaces, in the schools, about what is meant by it. One of the concrete proposals that came out is that they talked about having a kind of week-long event in London and a week-long event in Caracas, in the course of the next 12 months, around the subject of the socialism of the 21st century."" Bring people from Latin America and also from other parts of Europe. They talked about engaging with us in helping to set up something like that, as a real point of taking on the political arguments about, when we say ""another world is possible,"" when we say ""the Socialism of the 21st Century,"" what do we mean by that and how can we achieve it. Because I think that they recognise that they cannot do it as an isolated country, hence the Bolivarian dream. But they also recognise that even just within Latin America, it needs to be a wider socialism that they build. A lot of people there talked about some of the ideas coming out of the international movements that they've been involved in. They want to reengage with those international movements. So I think that it would be very important for us to engage with that and to try to help host in London part of it. They're talking about a substantial kind of event happening which opens up the political debate, not just the kind of statistics about health and education, but where do we go, why are we doing this, how do we achieve that socialism? Just finally in terms of what happens from now with the TUC, because it was a TUC delegation. A report is compiled and I have to say, there was four of us on the delegation and our politics kind of were not the same. Whilst broadly we were all supportive of the Bolivarian Revolution, you kind of went from me on the left to other people on the right, so much so that one person even kind of proposed that we should still keep links with both the CTV and the UNT. That won't be the position. What's going there did very much firm up in the minds of those people, who maybe were not as involved as I and one or two others have been up to then, that there was a genuine revolutionary process, there was the participation of millions of people, there were very real and concrete social advances in health and education and other areas that were there to see, not just in statistics, but actually you could go and physically look at them. That some of the new organisations, social movements and the UNT trade union federation were actually genuine expressions of the debate and discussion that is going on right across Venezuela. And that there is a genuine attempt to build a form of socialism and that that deserves the support of the British trade union movement. And I think that is what the TUC report effectively will say. That gives us very big opportunities to be able to engage a wider layer of people in the UK, a wider range of trade unions and activists and social movements, with the resources of the TUC behind some of those campaigns, to be able to get more people involved in the solidarity work. Because nobody in Venezuela underestimates the difficulties that they have in building that socialism of the 21st century, surrounded as they are by opposition. From the US, but also Colombia is being used against them. They still have their own internal opposition, who are waiting for the first opportunity to be able to strike against them. They still have the power of the opposition media there, which is continually, daily, churning out anti-Chávez propaganda. Rather bizarrely, when we said to President Chávez, at the end of the dinner we had with him: ""If you could get us to do one thing, in terms of solidarity, what would it be?"" he said: ""Forget about Venezuela, go to Bolivia, they need your help more than we do!"" Whilst maybe he was being a little flippant, what he recognised was that the success of Bolivia ties in with the success of Venezuela, ties in with the power to deliver that on a wider international basis. They were very keen that we talk about solidarity for the principles of socialism and not just for the Venezuela government or the Venezuelan project, but actually that it is a wider battle of ideas between the socialism that he and others envisage and the neo-liberal agenda that has brought so much misery to parts of Latin America over a long period of time. Probably as you can tell from me, and I think certainly from the other people who were on the delegation, we've kinda come back inspired and ever more ready to do more and more to build the kind of solidarity that's needed.

													Adam Ley-lange"," On Thursday 1 st June Jose Antonio Hernandez, a Venezuelan Activist from Caracas, member of the Revolutionary Socialist Youth and spokesperson of the Revolutionary Front of Workers of companies occupied and under co-management FRETECO, completed his speaking tour of Scotland and Northern England. The meeting marked the culmination of a highly successful visit, and all on the day before his 22 nd birthday! The meeting was held at the CWU Postal Workers Union Club, Brunswick Place, and was attended by around 60 people. This represents a major victory for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Edinburgh, the first meeting of which attracted less than 10 people. It was also a welcome opportunity to receive a first hand account of the events that have taken place in Venezuela since 1992, and cut through the blackouts and distortions conveyed by the media. After commenting upon the processes occurring within Venezuela, Jose Antonio also took questions from the floor. What followed was a reasonable amount of questions, and a couple of contributions. Members of the audience were keen to find out how they could help the movement within Venezuela, the relationship of Venezuela with other Latin American countries, and how the mass of the population were trying to take their destinies into their own hands. We hope that the answers that were provided will encourage people to become more involved with the campaign here in Scotland. We also received a pleasing financial result, with a collection of almost £100, and a good sale with the reading material that we had brought. This will enable us to build for public events in the future, especially during Edinburgh University Freshers Week in September. The same day but few hours earlier Jose Antonio Hernandez had spoken at the UNISON Local Government branch in Falkirk where about 20 shop stewards and trade union activists heard a lead-off about workers' control and co-management. That branch was one of the first ones in Scotland to affiliate to the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign and sent two delegates to the first National Conference. Motions of solidarity with the victimised workers at RACE were also distributed. The Edinburgh University Hands Off Venezuela Society would like to thank Jose Antonio Hernandez for his inspirational visit, and to wish him well in his interventions in the movement within Venezuela.

													Pablo Sanchez, Hands Off Venezuela"," While the Scottish Parliament had the pleasure of listening to Prince Charles waffling on about something, in the same building for the first time ever a Venezuelan revolutionary was talking about the need for the World Socialist Revolution. It was certainly a refreshing speech by Jose Antonio Hernandez on his third day in Scotland, and the event will have enormously helped to strengthen the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The meeting was hosted by Frances Curran, SSP MSP and organised by Barbara Scott, a Parliamentary assistant for the SSP Group. Hands Off Venezuela would like to use this opportunity to thank them and all the other MSP's that have supported us. After showing Jose Antonio Hernandez and members of HOV around Parliament, a press conference was held, which 20 people attended, including 5 MSP's from three different parties. Frances Curran (who chaired the meeting) and Rosie Kane from the SSP, Mark Ballard and Chris Ballance from the Greens and Elaine Smith from the Labour Party intervened. All the MSP's present were enthused by the range of the social reforms being carried out in Venezuela and how these are improving the lives of millions of people. Elaine Smith even proposed a cross party group on Venezuela. Jose Antonio Hernández gave a brief outline of the situation in Venezuela and raised with the MSP's the need for international solidarity. He explained the case of the Union of Retail Pharmaceutical Proletarians in the company RACE. All those attending took on board their demands and promised to send solidarity messages and try to put the campaign on the floor of the Scottish Parliament. So far the Scottish Parliament has seen two motions presented on Venezuela. One from Rosie Kane, SSP(Glasgow), S2M-2576, against the assassination plots by the US government and another by Frances Curran (West of Scotland), S2M-3968, highlighting the social developments that have been achieved in Venezuela and the need to denounce the attacks from internal and external opponents. (You can read the motions on the website of the Scottish Parliament). The visit to Holyrood was the highlight of a very successful speaking tour that should boost the development of Hands Off Venezuela and strengthen the ties between Venezuelan and Scottish revolutionaries.

On Tuesday 20th June Hands off Venezuela activists held a UNISON conference fringe meeting, with Rob Sewell and John McDonnell MP speaking. The activists spent two days campaigning for the meeting, handing out leaflets for the event as well as selling the new magazine.

As so often seems to be the case in recent years, there was a noticeable increase in interest in our organization and goals; this was displayed by a record HoV fringe meeting attendance of roughly 70-80 people, strong sales of literature and a lively, positive and encouraging question and answer session after the opening speeches.

Rob Sewell outlined to the delegates attending the fringe meeting the significance of Venezuela in the world, while emphasising its democratic credentials and the fact that it is indeed a genuine revolution, with millions mobilising and actively taking part in public life for the first time ever. He also gave a brief history of the country since Chavez was elected in 1998.

John McDonnell then added his comments and thoughts on the immense significance the Venezuelan revolution plays for activists throughout the world. He said it reinvigorated activists in Europe.

Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the NUJ, was part of the delegation and will be reporting back at a meeting in London on Wednesday June 14th.   PRESS RELEASE FROM HANDS OFF VENEZUELA  CALLING NOTICE: Debriefing from members of the TUC delegation to Venezuela on Wednesday June 14 at 7pm at the NUJ headquarters (308 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1, nearest tube: Kings Cross).  Since the visit by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to London last month, there has been an upsurge in interest about his country's Bolivarian Revolution, among activists, trade unionists and the general public alike.  During the whirlwind two-day trip, the left-wing leader met and spoke to grass-roots supporters, the TUC general council, sympathetic MPs, the mayor at a celebrity lunch in City Hall and the business community at the Canning House annual lecture.  The following week, the TUC sent its first official delegation to Venezuela, which met with President Chavez and trade union leaders, as well as other representatives of the country's social movements.  Members of the delegation participated in the second national conference of the new trade union federation, the UNT, which was created as an alternative to the discredited CTV federation.  The CTV conspired with the major bosses' group Fedecamaras to bring down the democratically elected government in the two-day April 2002 coup and during the 10-week-long bosses' lockout six months later, which was inaccurately portrayed as a general strike.  On both occasions, the privately owned media was used to destabilise the country and create unrest. National Union of Journalists general secretary Jeremy Dear addressed the UNT conference on behalf of his union.  Mr Dear discussed launching a media initiative with President Chavez, which aims to facilitate exchanges of information between journalists in the two countries and encourage direct links between media organisations.  He will be speaking at a report-back debriefing on Wednesday June 14 from  7pm at the NUJ headquarters in London, organised by solidarity campaign Hands Off Venezuela.  NOTES FOR EDITORS:  The meeting begins at 7pm on Wednesday June 14 at the National Union of Journalists headquarters, 308 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1 (nearest tube: Kings Cross).

On June 19, Hands Off Venezuela in Providence, RI held an event around the film Venezuela from Below. Supporters flyered heavily for the event a few weeks before and contacted everyone that had participated in past HOV activities. There was a positive response from many people who planned to attend. Campaign members called several union locals to inform them of the event as well.  The event was scheduled for 7pm, but several people showed up early and began to informally discuss Venezuela for about a half an hour. Right at 7 o'clock, most of the attendees had shown up, which is something that seldom happens at events like these, where people tend to trickle in 10 to 15 minutes late. Some 25 people showed up to see the film.  Shane Jones of Rhode Island HOV gave a brief introduction to the event. He explained a brief history of the HOV campaign and some of its recent achievements (the West Coast Luis Primo tour, the Austrian HOV organizing an event for Chavez to speak etc.). He also explained the changes in the situation that have taken place since the movie was made - the further nationalizations, the electoral sweep of the Bolivarian candidates, the movement of the Bolivian masses, the electoral victory of Morales and the partial nationalization of hydrocarbons in Bolivia. He also explained how the US is stepping up pressure and making unfounded accusations and rumors about Venezuela, the elections in Colombia and Peru, and the joint force military exercises the US is carrying out in the Caribbean. Jones then made a concrete proposal to set up a broad HOV committee in Providence and for a discussion about this after the film. The film was received with great interest, with several people taking notes. After the film, a time and place was agreed on for the next meeting, and several people made comments and raised questions, all in a positive and productive atmosphere.  The HOV campaign sold several DVDs, HoV magazines, and pins. Several donations were also made to the campaign.   The next meeting, to be held on the 10th of July, will be the kick off for a successful summer/fall HOV campaign in the city. Several of the people on the committee have traveled to Venezuela and plan to speak about their first-hand experiences publicly.

Frances Curran, who chaired the meeting with Jose Antonio Hernandez, member of the JSR (Revolutionary Socialist Youth) and spokesperson for the FRETECO (Revolutionary Front of Factories Occupied and under Co-management), wrote the following motion: Supporters of this motion on 8 June 2006 : Tommy Sheridan, Rosie Kane, Carolyn Leckie, Colin Fox, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mark Ballard, Chris Ballance, Elaine Smith. We would like to ask all HOV supporters and members to write their MSP asking them to sign the motion. We would also ask that where possible HOV supporters raise this issue in their own trade union or local branch. We would like to thank the members and staff of the SSP Parliamentary Group, especially Barbara Scott, as well as all the MSPs that attended the meeting and have signed the petition, pushing the issue of solidarity with Jhony Coronil and Andry Key.

													Hands Off Venezuela (Canada)"," Over 40 people jammed into a downtown Hamilton hangout to watch a screening of the film, Venezuela Bolivarina: People and struggle of the 4th World War . The event was put on by Hands Off Venezuela, the November 16 Coalition, and the Skydragon Centre. The film brought about an enthusiastic response from the audience, especially the significance of Venezuela’s fight for socialism for the rest of the Americas. Activists from Hands Off Venezuela and the November 16 Coalition answered a slew of questions on the events in Venezuela and elsewhere in Latin America. More importantly, people were concerned about how Canadians can best help the Venezuelan Revolution. Camilo Cahis from HOV answered that Chávez has said in the past that the best way to help Venezuela is to build our own revolutions; the response drew great applause. A common theme through the evening was how the Canadian working class has much to learn from their Venezuelan counterparts, especially in an area that has suffered huge job losses in manufacturing. The evening ended with a very healthy collection and merchandise sales that are helping to build the Hands Off Venezuela campaign across Canada. Hands Off Venezuela greatly appreciates the support of the November 16 Coalition and the Skydragon Centre in arranging the film screening. Several people in the audience expressed an interest in launching a branch of the HOV campaign in Hamilton. If you are interested in getting involved, please contact canada[@]handsoffvenezuela.org .

													Darrall Cozens, NATFHE Regional Committee and Hands off Venezuela Committee"," Darrall Cozens, member of the NATFHE Regional Committee and Hands off Venezuela Committee, gives his personal account of the visit of President Hugo Chavez to London. After having spent the last three years campaigning in the labour and trade union movement for the defence and extension of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela, now was the opportunity to see in the flesh the man who epitomises for so many the social advances that have been made in that country. The first task was to get a seat in the limited capacity Camden Town Hall. The hall could hold only 800 people and on the Friday evening before this meeting Chavez had spoken in Vienna at a meeting organised by the Austrian section of the Hands off Venezuela (HoV) campaign and 5000 (!!) had turned up to listen to him. The meeting there had to be turned into an open air one in a large square next to the meeting hall. (See Vienna, May 12: Hugo Chávez addresses mass rally organised by Hands off Venezuela! .) What would the response be in London? The organisation of the meeting was undertaken by Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Authority (GLA). Originally HoV were going to host a meeting on the Tuesday evening of Chavez's visit. Then the TUC sponsored Venezuela Information Centre (VIC) decided to hold one on the Monday evening. HoV proposed a joint meeting, but eventually the GLA took over responsibility. Before this meeting started on the Sunday afternoon, however, several events had already happened. We arrived in London (travel down from Coventry would have cost £33 so I had organised a ticket for another NATFHE member Vincenzo Infantino and he drove down with the two of us buying day travel passes for London) and by 10.30am were taking part in a welcoming picket for Chavez outside the Savoy Hotel in the Strand organised by HoV and the Bolivarian circles in London (see pictures here and here ). Chavez was supposed to arrive at about 11.30 am so we were in buoyant mood chanting slogans (oooooo...aaaaaa, Chavez no se va - oooo..aaa Chavez isn't going) and singing songs in a variety of languages, mainly Spanish and English. Quite a surprise for the usual clientele of the Savoy! So we sang and chanted and waited... and time passed. The plane had arrived on time at Heathrow so why the delay? What we didn't know was that Chavez was at the airport in a press conference and he was taking his time. We began to flag! After almost 4 hours his cavalcade of cars swung into the entrance to the hotel and security popped out from everywhere. Understandable really as he has been threatened with assassination by the right wing in Venezuela and the USA, so no chances were being taken. We had been told that he would come and talk to us before going into the hotel, but as he approached us the waiting crowds rushed forward and the orderly assembly disintegrated into an enthusiastic throng. Palms were pressed and hugs exchanged. Old ones like me kept at the back away from the crush. For about 30 minutes Chavez stayed and then disappeared with his entourage into the hotel. We then made our way to the hall for the meeting expecting it to start very late as the schedule was already way behind. Chavez was due to open a museum at Miranda House and then come to the meeting. So as not to disappoint the waiting crowd, however, he missed out Miranda House and came straight to Camden. By the time we arrived by tube we were at the back of the queue and so had to occupy the balconies upstairs overlooking the flag-waving chanting audience below. The cries went up. Venezuela - presente! Chile - presente! Bolivia - presente! Haiti - presente! I wanted to shout Pais de Gales (Wales) but refrained. The dignitaries' filed out with Chavez occupying centre stage. As he appeared there was a rapturous ovation and much hand waving. The platform settled down and the composition was interesting. Ken Livingstone was there as the main organiser. Paul Mackney was there in recognition, I presume, of NATFHE's work on Venezuela. Earlier I had seen the Wilkins family outside unable to get into the meeting! Richard Gott was there as the Latin American correspondent for over 30 years of the Guardian. Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary, was also there representing HoV. Andy Goodhall from VSC was there as was a representative from the TUC VIC. At this stage I was beginning to wonder why certain people were up on the platform especially as there was Tariq Ali, the ex-Marxist who in the last election could not bring himself to vote Labour so had become a Liberal for the day. Strange bedfellows! There were three speakers before Chavez. Ken Livingstone introduced and chaired the session, the speaker from VIC and Jeremy Dear from HoV. And then it was Chavez. For 3 and half hours he spoke without notes and with microphone in hand. From personal anecdotes to an analysis of the world today, from theory to practice, citing his heroes and ideas that he followed, from Jesus Christ (I am a Christian) to Karl Marx (I am a Socialist) with Lenin and Guevara in between. The basic message was that he had tried to find a third way between capitalism and socialism and found that the former offered no solution, so socialism had to be the answer. What type of socialism was open to debate as the process of social advance deepened. Chavez, however, invited all of the audience to share in this debate and take the message out into the streets to combat the ideas of the mass media. He even suggested that a badge should be worn that declared the wearer to be a socialist in order to engage others in discussion. What was rejected was the dominant economic model of the USA that only meant slavery for the developing world. For Chavez, humanity had two choices - socialism or barbarism. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. More chanting, singing, hand pressing and hugs. By now it was nearing 9pm and time to hit the motorway as work was on the morrow. It was an exhilarating experience that rejuvenates the heart and soul. Forward with the work on Venezuela. Forward to the NATFHE conference and the debate on Venezuela. The following day, however, the press and the media in Britain had a field day castigating Chavez for taking action against foreign companies in order to boost the income of the government to enable it to carry out its social programmes. The Convenor of HoV has written to the Press Council complaining of the bile that emanated from the Daily Mail. Other papers weren't quite as bad, but none were neutral or favourable. For those who are interested, it is worthwhile clicking on to venezuelanalysis.com for an analysis of how the media treats Chavez. Thanks to the West Midlands Regional Committee for supporting the trip down. If the chance comes again to see the man in the flesh, I would recommend it to everyone.

													Chris Rutherford"," On the 31 st of May, Hands off Venezuela and our comrades at Scottish Socialist Youth organised a joint meeting in Glasgow to kick off the Venezuelan Marxist Jose Antonio Hernandez's speaking tour of Scotland. Jose is a member of both the International Marxist Tendency and the Revolutionary Socialist Youth in Venezuela. The packed room of 45 seemed eager to hear what he had to say, and there was a feeling of anticipation in the room as he prepared to speak. These numbers were especially good, considering there was an SSP meeting taking place in Glasgow at the same time. It was a fantastic opportunity for all attending to hear about exactly what was happening on the ground in Venezuela. Jack Ferguson (SSY national organizer) introduced the meeting, before Jose spoke about events in Venezuela. Jose opened by saying that "" The Bolivarian Revolution is born out of the contradictions of capitalism in Venezuela."" He was animated in describing life in Venezuela before the revolution, and talked of the inflation that caused the original uprisings there. He spoke of Chavez's rise to power, and about his moves towards socialism, and all he has done to help the Venezuelan working class. His speech finished rather aptly with the Karl Marx quote, ""Workers of the World unite!"" A long question and answer session followed, with questions ranging from the general feel in Venezuela, to specific issues such as the wages for housewives initiative. People were very interested in hearing his answers to their questions, as it is a rare opportunity to be able to talk about Venezuela to someone who has been working within the revolution there. After the meeting, the mood was positive, and I can't help but think this was more than just a meeting: it was a kick-starter for some action. ",NA,NA

													Charley Allan - Morning Star"," Charley Allan hears Jeremy Dear report on his recent Venezuela visit. National Union of Journalists general secretary Jeremy Dear, who recently went on the first official TUC delegation to Venezuela, gave a debriefing to solidarity activists on Wednesday night at the union's headquarters. The delegation set out the week after last month's visit to London by President Hugo Chavez. Last year, the TUC was the first European trade union federation to pass a motion supporting Mr Chavez and Venezuela. At Wednesday's meeting, organised by Hands Off Venezuela, Mr Dear described the second national congress of the new workers' federation UNT, which he had addressed on behalf of the TUC. ""There was a kind of fervour, a sense that they were creating something new,"" he said. ""People talked all the time about putting that slogan that we all use, 'Another world is possible,' into practice."" Not every encounter was so inspiring. The old coup-plotting neoliberal trade union federation CTV is technically still the official ILO-affiliated organisation. The delegation visited its headquarters, ""most of which is empty, pretty much in darkness, yellowed posters on the wall,"" recalled Mr Dear. ""We went into this room and met a group of men sat round a black reflective table. It was like a scene out of Reservoir Dogs."" The delegation asked CTV general secretary Manuel Cova why his union had been involved in the 2002 coup. ""He looked affronted and denied any involvement, denying also that he personally was involved in the coup,"" Mr Dear recalled. ""So we produced photos of him sat in the palace, and said: 'That's you, isn't it? And this was the coup.' ""He went: 'Ah, now I see the confusion. This wasn't a coup, it was a popular uprising against President Chavez.' ""That is the way that they justify their participation in the coup, by saying that it was a popular uprising!"" Mr Dear highlighted the contrast of the UNT headquarters saying: ""There was activity everywhere. ""I know they were in the build-up to the UNT congress, but it showed that the opposition, certainly the opposition in the trade union movement, have no forces. ""Those forces that they have are not from the workers in the factories, are not from the working people, but from the elite."" His experience of the conference was also positive. ""We spent the first three hours reading out socialist, Bolivarian and solidarity greetings from virtually every workplace in the whole of Venezuela. ""It was a slightly laborious but inspiring process. You can't quite imagine the TUC conference saying: 'And the people who work at Tesco in Hither Green would like to send socialist greetings to the TUC!' ""Every time there was one of these, everyone stood up on the chairs and cheered,"" he said. ""The cheering went on for about five minutes after every one, until everyone calmed them down. ""Then the next one was read out. ""What was clear from everybody was their absolute support for the revolutionary process that is happening. The UNT is growing at a huge rate. ""So many new union branches have been formed in the run-up to the congress, people who have moved from the CTV to the UNT, that they actually had a huge struggle with the registration process,"" Mr Dear said. The TUC delegation left before the crisis split at the conference on the second day, when disagreements over the timing of new elections led to walkouts and punch-ups.

													Heiko Khoo"," UNT leader Ruben Linares began his tour of Germany with a hectic schedule of meetings in Berlin. Greeted by members of the Berlin Venezuela Network and Hands Off Venezuela he immediately went to visit the strikers at the digger making factory, Case New Holland, where workers have been on strike for nearly three months against the planned closure of the plant by owners Fiat. Ruben discussed the history of the strike and the factory with the workers and union representatives, taking detailed notes. He was informed of the factory's 130-year history of producing some of the finest quality machines in the world, and how the new Fiat managers, through a senseless re-branding campaign succeeded in losing much of the traditional market share. Ruben was welcomed to speak at the daily strike meeting, which was attended by over 150 workers. He explained what he would report about the strike to his union in Venezuela. This was received with a tremendous applause by the strikers. After an evening with activists he met with the head of the Left Party, PDS, Lothar Brisky at Karl Liebknecht house. This contact was made thanks to the support for Hands off Venezuela from Andrej Hermlin, a renowned Jazz musician whose father Stephan was a famous writer and Communist fighter under Hitler as well as in the GDR. Comrade Lothar Brisky promised to call a Party conference on the processes in Latin American for November and that the issue of Venezuela would be at the top of the agenda. Hands off Venezuela encouraged comrade Brisky to invite President Chavez to Berlin where many thousands would be glad to hear him speak. Further meetings were held at Parliament with SPD MP Lothar Mark and with the international department of the DGB, the German Trade Union confederation, where friendly relations have now been established. On Wednesday May 17, Hands off Venezuela along with IG Metall (the international department) Europe's biggest trade union, Rotdorn the youth newspaper of SOLID (Left Party youth) for Berlin-Brandenburg, the Left Party PDS, and the Venezuela Network, held a packed meeting at the conference centre of IG Metall with over 120 people present. Unfortunately a few days before the meeting a handful of sectarian activists from the WASG ""Electoral Alternative for Social Justice"" arranged a meeting on the same day and at the same time. This meeting was to take place some 500 meters away with Stalin Perez speaking, who is also in the UNT leadership. In order to avoid pointless competition we invited Stalin Perez and the WASG to attend our long planned meeting. Ruben Linares made a tremendous speech explaining the advances and problems confronting the Venezuelan Revolution and the Venezuelan working class in particular. Among those present were Helmut Schulz from the Left Party-PDS leadership, the Marxist actress Kaethe Reichel, the Venezuelan Ambassador to Germany, Blanca Nieva, and a wide cross section of people from school students to pensioners. The meeting tapped into the evident thirst for information on Venezuela that exists. People see the hope of the world in developments there. On Thursday Ruben visited a major works depot of the Berlin buses and trams, holding detailed discussions with the leaders of the works council and touring the works informing himself about working conditions and the many struggles against privatisation and staff reduction, which have reduced the staff levels from over 27,000 15 years ago to some 11,000 today. A detailed exchange of views and experiences allowed both sides to see how the rights of the Berlin transport workers and the Venezuelan transport workers can be advanced. It became clear that the conditions of work in public sector transport in Berlin were far superior to Venezuela, yet the legal and political framework in Venezuela is in many senses superior to that in Germany. We discussed the means used to bring together transport workers from across Europe and the world. Ruben Linares invited the comrades from Berlin to the National Congress of transport workers in Venezuela, due to be held in the autumn this year. Hands off Venezuela is proud to have initiated the process that will lead to the recognition of the UNT by the German unions and which will also place Venezuela at the top of the agenda on the Left in Germany.

They discussed the overall situation in Latin America, with a focus on the latest developments in Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, and the immigration rights movement here in the U.S. Over 40 people attended and the mood was attentive and enthusiastic. Many actively participated in the question and answer session, reflecting a growing interest in political discussion here the U.S. Although a broad variety of topics were covered, including a lively discussion on the lessons of the Nicaraguan Revolution in relation to the process in Venezuela, much of the discussion focused on ways to build consciousness here in the U.S., with the immigration rights movement an important point of reference.

Also highlighted during the discussion was the revolutionary movement of the masses in these countries and how their demands can be met. There was a lively discussion following Jorge’s talk, with many people wanting to know more details about the gains of the Bolivarian Revolution, especially in regards to education. There was an emphasis placed on the valuable lessons that the revolutions in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Cuba can give to Canadian workers and youth; Jorge commented that Hugo Chávez stated in the past that the best way to support Venezuela is to build revolution elsewhere.

													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela - www.ushov.org"," For audio of Jorge's speech click here One day after Chavez's monumental speech in Vienna, 50 people came to see Jorge Martin, international secretary for the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, speak on the process of world revolution at St. Louis University as part of his US-Canadian Tour. His presentation was called ""A World in Revolt"" and focused on events going on in Venezuela, Bolivia, France, and the USA, outlining the processes at work on an international scale and the impact these have on the world working-class movement. The event was put on by the St. Louis Venezuela Solidarity Committee and events like this are essential in order to bring the experience of the Latin American Revolution to the United States amidst the fog of lies about what is actually going on in the region. In recent months, the corporate media has stepped up its attacks on Latin America, particularly Venezuela, Bolivia, and Cuba. For instance, the day after Morales' partial nationalization on May Day, Fox News' Neil Cavuto, in typical ""fair and balanced"" fashion, had military analysts on to assess the ""threat"" posed militarily by Chavez and Morales. Kaveh Razani, chair of the St. Louis club of the Young Communist League, opened the event relaying his exciting experiences as part of the World Festival of Youth and Students. He was followed by Mike Mancini of the School of Social Work at St. Louis University, who had just returned from a trip to Venezuela, what he described as a ""listening tour"" taken by school teachers and professors. Jorge Martin, International Secretary of Hands Off Venezuela Jorge began by detailing the partial nationalization of gas resources in Bolivia and explaining that, ""This would not happened if it wasn't because of the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, and the hope it has given to the working-class, the peasant movement, and the left-wing progressive movements throughout the continent."" In doing this, he laid out the interdependence of individual revolutionary movements to the continent-wide, and increasingly worldwide, revolutionary upsurge and ferment. One of the most important features of the Bolivarian Revolution is that despite attacks from the ruling class, ""Ordinary working people in Venezuela have defeated once and again all the attempts of counter-revolution...This is very important, because in Latin America it gives hope to a whole generation, who were coming from the 1970s where there were, also, a number of progressive governments...In all occasions, these movements were defeated, were smashed, through military dictatorships, supported by the United States administration. And there was a feeling of hopelessness...However, Venezuela proves that this is not the case."" He then drew an essential connection between the leftward swing in Latin America to the immigrant rights movement here in the US. Both are not isolated movements, but rather, are part of a general process, one that cannot be contained within the borders of bourgeois nation-states. Thus, the revolution in Venezuela is not only relevant to Venezuelans but is, ""relevant to working people around the world, even in advanced, industrial countries."" Jorge then described many of the gains of the Venezuelan Revolution, even during its relatively short existence. He talked about the war on illiteracy, the creation of the free and progressive Bolivarian University, the Into the Neighborhood healthcare campaign, and the redistribution of idle land. These all involve direct participation of the masses in the running of their daily lives, and this is democracy. ""And this is dangerous,"" to the ruling class of Venezuela and ultimately to international bourgeoisie. ",NA,NA

													Steve Jones in Bournemouth"," Thirty delegates and visitors from the national conference of the Communication Workers Union attended the very first Hands Off Venezuela fringe meeting, held on Monday lunchtime in windswept Bournemouth. The day before, the 250,000-strong union, which organises both postal and telecommunications workers, had unanimously agreed to support the Venezuelan Revolution and also affiliate nationally to HOV. The fringe meeting itself was officially sponsored by the union, which also met the costs of refreshments, as was the room hire, covered by a generous donation from London branch 7. Rob Sewell, who chaired the meeting, gave a welcome to all present and thanked the conference delegates for voting to affliliate the union to HOV. Espe Espigares, from the HOV national steering committee, started things off referring to the tremendous impact of President Chavez's visit to London last week. She went on to summarise some of the attacks which had been launched against the Bolivarian Revolution and how they differed from the reality of the situation. Indeed, she added, it would take two hours, at least, to list all the advances in social care, education, health, etc. which had been carried out over the last few years - including the abolition of illiteracy - in Venezuela. The next speaker was Tony Kearns, senior assistant general secretary of the CWU, who came along to stress the union's international solidarity with the struggle of the Venezuelan masses and the CWU's support for Chavez against the attacks from Bush and co. The final speaker was Jane Loftus from the CWU National Executive, who had been one of the union's two delegates to the WSF rally in Venezuela last January. She was able to provide first hand experience of what it was like to see the revolution unfolding before her very eyes. She said she was able to see clearly what advances had been made but also warned of the dangers from the forces of reaction and the need to mobilise support and solidarity. Although the meeting was a very short one, organised in between two sessions of conference, the mood was very good and a number of CWU activists expressed interest in getting speakers from HOV to address their local branches. Nealy £100 worth of DVDs, magazines and t-shirts were also sold. The following is the full text of the resolution passed by CWU Conference: ",NA,NA

			Venezuela and the NATFHE Conference 2006",2006-05-31T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Darrall Cozens, West Midland Region Delegate"," On Monday May 29 th 2006 the NATFHE Annual Conference meeting in Blackpool discussed the issue of Venezuela for the third time in three years. In moving the motion, Darrall Cozens from the West Midlands region, made no apology for bringing the issue to the conference yet again. He told the conference that at this moment in time the struggle of the forces for social change in the direction of socialism against the forces of capitalist reaction are far more developed in Venezuela than in any other country, and that if the USA were not bogged down in Iraq the issue of Venezuela would be dominating the international media far more than it is as the US would be making far serious efforts to overthrow the Bolivarian government. The motion before the conference was mainly of an organisational nature and Darrall reminded the conference that in previous years the political points that had been made were still valid today. NATFHE had previously applauded the social changes initiated by the Bolivarian revolution; had recognised the need to defend the gains against internal and external reaction; and had also stated that to maintain the momentum for social change and thwart reaction, it was necessary to extend the revolution. In the same way that you cannot make half an omelette, you cannot make half a revolution. Internal reaction at this point in time was not open but elements of the oligarchy had been engaged in economic sabotage by withholding goods from the market to try and discredit the government. The main thrust of the motion was firstly to recognise the role that NATFHE had played over Venezuela. It was NATFHE that had facilitated the first national conference of the Hands off Venezuela campaign in December 2005. It was NATFHE's president John Wilkins who had moved the resolution on Venezuela at the TUC conference in September 2005. And just over two weeks ago it was no accident that Paul Mackney, NATFHE's general secretary, was on the platform when President Chavez spoke at the Camden Town Hall. Chavez mentioned Paul in his speech. Darrall also pointed out, however, the irony that whilst he and Paul were in the hall listening to Chavez, John and his wife Chris Wilkins were outside unable to get in as they did not have a ticket. After the conference had discussed the motion John did tell us that he had been able to meet Chavez personally at the TUC the following day! The second part of the motion asked conference to broaden and deepen the work on Venezuela by raising the issue at all levels of the union, by inviting speakers from HoV and by working with other unions. Only the forces of the trade union and labour movement would be able to combat the lies and distortions that are pouring out of the pens of writers in the capitalist media. Examples were given of where Chavez is described as an ""aggressively populist left-wing leader"" (Times May 12 2006) or an ""international revolutionary firebrand"" (Observer May 7 2006) and the ""Crackers from Caracas"" (Mirror May 16 2006), as well as being called an ""elected dictator"" and Venezuela an ""authoritarian democracy"". A serious and orchestrated campaign was therefore underway to belittle, denigrate and besmirch Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution so that when externally moves are made to invade the country from Columbia or even assassinate Chavez, and internally to overthrow the government as was attempted in April 2002, it would be seen as a logical and necessary move by people all over the world who had been duped by the international media. The ground was being prepared for such moves against the gains of the Bolivarian revolution, to manipulate public opinion, to lampoon Chavez, to show that he cannot be trusted and was therefore incapable of leading a country. The task of NATFHE, together with other unions, was to take the message of the Bolivarian revolution to all levels of the movement, to counter the lies of the media, to alert trade unionists of developments, to warn and prepare our forces to defend the gains that have been made. Darrall emphasised that history is not made by individuals, but by classes fighting to control the surplus value, the wealth that is created by the labour of working people. However, it also has to be recognised that at times in history there are individuals who epitomise the aspirations of a people for social change. Chavez is such an individual. There is an interrelationship between Chavez and the Bolivarian masses who react on each other. Their instinctive demands for social change push Chavez to the left and his speeches on socialism push in turn the masses in a socialist direction. As such the cries of the Bolivarian movement in August 2004 during the recall referendum were just as pertinent today - ""Uh, ah, Chavez no se va!"". Two amendments to the motion were put to conference and approved. The first was that conference should not only support HoV but also other similar organisations and the second condemned the attacks on the Venezuelan Government by Tony Blair when he demanded that Chavez obey the rules of the ""international community"" and also called upon the Labour leadership to recognise the far-reaching social reforms of the Bolivarian Revolution. The NATFHE conference was celebrating the end of an era in that NATFHE as a union is to disappear on June 1 st as it unites with the Association of University Teachers to form the University and Colleges Union (UCU), the largest trade union for post-16 education in the world with 120,000 members. We hope that the excellent work on Venezuela carried out by NATFHE over the last three years will also be continued in the new union. Darrall Cozens, West Midland Region Delegate ",NA,NA

			Hugo Chavez in Historic Visit to London",2006-05-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," The visit of President Hugo Chavez to London was one of enormous enthusiasm. Thousands of supporters turned out to see the President over his two-day visit, which was hosted by Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London. Five welcoming rallies were organised by Hands Off Venezuela in different locations over the two days with the full support of the Bolivarian Circles and the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign. These began with a lively rally outside the President's hotel in Central London. People brought flags, banners and placards, dressed in red T-shirts and painted faces. Singing and chanting took place for three hours before the President finally arrived and ""Uh! Ah! Chavez no se va!"" continually echoed in the entrance of the Savoy Hotel. On behalf of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, Rob Sewell of the HOV steering committee welcomed everybody, explaining that this visit by Hugo Chavez was an historic occasion that served to highlight the Venezuelan Revolution. ""Two nights ago, Hands Off Venezuela in Austria organised a 5,000-stong meeting to greet the President. We must continue the welcome in Britain, which must be used to build support for the Revolution."" By the time the President arrived, the crowd had swollen to some 200 people, many with their own banners and placards. As the President stepped out of his car, the crowd surged forward and he was greeted with a storm of support. It was like a rugby scrum. Throwing aside all protocol, the President mixed with the crowd, shaking hands and greeting as many people as he possibly could, in particular the representatives of Hands Off Venezuela Espe Espigares, a member of the HOV Steering Committee, greeted President Chavez on behalf of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign and extended a very warm welcome on behalf of everybody present. After this brief conversation he thanked the HOV campaign for the tremendous work we were doing to support the Venezuelan Revolution. President Chavez said: ""I thank you for the work you are doing and I would encourage you to continue because this is very important for us and the Revolution"". Given the delay in the President's arrival, the scheduled visit to Miranda House was cancelled and the crowd made its way to the Camden Centre. Hundreds of people were queuing right round the building, as hundreds mingled outside, shouting slogans and waving banners. It is a shame that the organisers had not listened to the solidarity organisations who were pressing for a much larger venue. When HOV first heard of the visit, we immediately contacted the Venezuelan Ambassador in London and then tried to secure the Royal Albert Hall for a mass rally for Chavez. Unfortunately, despite our representations, our efforts were turned down. We were later informed that the organisation of the visit had been put exclusively in the hands of Ken Livingstone's Greater London Authority. HOV had prepared posters and leaflets for the meeting, but were informed that no publicity was allowed. And although we had insisted on an open meeting, the mayor's office unilaterally decided that it was to be by invitation only. The capacity of the Camden Centre was 800, but more than 5,000 people had applied to attend via the Great London Authority website. It seems strange that the Mayor of London could not find a bigger venue than this. In the event, hundreds of people were turned away. Hands Off Venezuela was allocated only 100 tickets for the event, which were snapped up within one hour. Hundreds more applied for tickets through HOV but, given the scandalous shortage of tickets, we were unable to provide them. The hall itself was packed with an enthusiastic, placard-carrying, banner-waving audience. HOV had been told that no banners were allowed in the meeting, but this was clearly not the case, so our large banner was hastily brought in and draped over the balcony facing the platform. Ken Livingstone, who chaired the proceedings, called on two speakers to introduce the meeting. The first was Keith Sonnet, assistant general secretary of Unison, representing the Venezuela Information Centre, who wanted those who threatened Venezuela to know that they faced huge opposition. The second was Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, representing the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. Jeremy stated that President Chavez's visit was having an electrifying effect. He praised Ken Livingstone's efforts as the host, but felt that a far larger venue would have been more appropriate given the thousands of people keen to hear Chavez. ""There are thousands of people out there desperate to hear President Chavez"", he said. He called on the President to return to London in the future where a far larger reception will be organised. When President Chavez was introduced, there was an enthusiastic response from the crowd. Chavez thanked the people of Britain for their hospitality and launched into a three hour speech, outlining the background and successes of the Bolivarian Revolution. In the first words of his speech, Chavez mentioned the gathering in Vienna, attended by 5,000 young people. He explicitly thanked Alan Woods and Hands Off Venezuela for organising this marvellous meeting. Hugo Chavez went on to deal with the Bolivarian Revolution and contributions of Simon Bolivar and Francisco de Miranda, who had visited and lived in London. He explained how the great Industrial Revolution in Britain and the great French Revolution had attracted the greatest thinkers of the age. Bolivar's struggle was inspired by these events in Europe. Chavez also praised the scientific socialism of Marx and Engels, although these must not be treated as a dogma. He went on to attack capitalism and imperialism for the destruction they were bringing to the planet. He referred to Rosa Luxemburg and her great contribution and repeated the phrase: ""Socialism or Barbarism"". Chavez emphasised his commitment to socialism. ""I am a socialist. We are all socialists"", he declared. Socialism, he said, was the only way to save the world, the future of which was threatened by capitalism. He went on to say that the idea that History had ended was completely false. Referring to the power of great ideas, Chavez explained that Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin and Che Guevara were not dead. They are alive today in their ideas. Hugo Chavez made an unexpected offer to supply cheap fuel from two PDVSA refineries in Britain to poor neighbourhoods in London, which the Mayor accepted. This is similar to the schemes already implemented in the United States. As the meeting came to an end, Chavez came to the front of the platform to shake the hands of supporters. Despite all the problems it had been a most enthusiastic meeting. The next day, Hands Off Venezuela had called a reception rally outside the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress in Central London. Hands Off Venezuela magazines and leaflets were distributed as members entered the building. As the meeting was about to start, representatives of the Chavez delegation invited supporters of Hands Off Venezuela to come into to the TUC meeting, together with those of the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign. As we entered the building, TUC stewards tried to prevent us, but were over-ruled by Venezuelan security. About 100 people gathered at the TUC, members of the General Council and other trade union general secretaries. Hands Off Venezuela sat as a block in the meeting. The chairperson of the TUC, Gloria Mills, introduced the meeting by explaining that ""the TUC General Council has met in this building for 50 years. I must say, for me this is the most interesting meeting this year."" At this point, Hugo Chavez corrected her: ""for 50 years!"" which was met with laughter.The next speaker was Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, who welcomed President Chavez for coming to address the TUC. Barber called for ""a new kind of globalisation, with social justice and workers' rights."" He then called on Chavez to speak. But Chavez did not speak about globalisation. Instead, he proceeded to give the General Council a history lesson, starting with the French Revolution. He pointed out that the great Venezuelan revolutionary Miranda had lived as a political exile in London. He had been impressed by Britain's industrial revolution and the new ideas associated with it. Even then, he said, the seed of ideas which went beyond the framework of capitalism were present. This was the starting point for Bolivar. This was essentially pre-socialist thought, stated Chavez. Maybe the members of the General Council had never heard of Miranda, but they had certainly heard of the next political exile mentioned by Chavez: ""Karl Marx lived and was buried here. He was one of the greatest ideologists of scientific socialism. Bolivar was only aware of utopian socialism. But some people want to bury socialism. But this is not the case. Representatives of capitalism and neo-liberalism talked of the failure of socialism. But their theory has failed"", Chavez continued. Chavez then went on to talk about pre-Columbian society in Latin America and how before the Conquest, people lived under a socialistic system of society where there was no private property. He returned again to the theme of socialism, particularly scientific socialism (that is, Marxism). While pointing to the defects of the Soviet Union, he said it was important to bring together the experiences of the past. We needed new strengths, new alternatives, to bring about socialism. ""The workers of the world including Britain have a key role to play in this"", he said. ""We want 21st century socialism."" There is a threat to the world from ecological disaster. We have the war in Iraq and the threats against Iran. ""We cannot guarantee jobs, houses, or lives under capitalism. This is absolutely impossible under capitalism. Just look at the problems of youth unemployment in Europe, the crisis in pensions, and so on. We are anti-imperialists. But we are not against the ordinary people of the United States. They are our friends,"" he said. In a reply to a question, Chavez stated that his government was ""a workers' government, with a commitment to the workers."" He concluded his speech with the statement: ""There is a dramatic shift to the left in Latin America. This will happen in Europe and I hope throughout the world. This is the only hope for the world today."" As a token of friendship, the General Council presented Chavez with a Spanish translation of the classic English socialist book, ""The Ragged Trousered Philanthropist"" by Robert Tressel. This was certainly the most radical speech given to the TUC General Council in 50 years. It should be printed and circulated to all unions as part of the support for the Venezuelan Revolution. After the meeting at the TUC, HOV members went to City Hall where Chavez was holding a press conference and to Parliament to assist with the welcoming rally. When we arrived at the press conference we were greeted by part of the Venezuelan delegation that had also come from the TUC, which included Nicolas Maduro, the President of the National Assembly. There were around 200 people at the press conference, including guests. The first question addressed to Chavez came from a CNN reporter, who asked why Chavez had ""snubbed"" Tony Blair. Chavez, who was very sharp, replied that this was a stupid question and that the reporter should know better. The visit was a private one and he objected to the way that the press was trying to twist things. After making short work of that question, he took others, equally provocative, which included one implying that Venezuela was acting in an imperialist fashion, using oil as a political weapon to get its way: ""We have no plans to monopolise the oil and gas. We are just creating integration plans, like in Europe"", stated the President. When Chavez was compared by one Venezuelan reporter to George Bush, Chavez replied indignantly ""Don't ever compare me with him. Have I ever attacked or invaded another country? Have I killed people? George Bush is a criminal, an assassin. He should be tried for these offences and placed in prison"", he said. This was greeted by a storm of applause from the guests and even certain of the journalists, although this enthusiasm was not shared by the escualidos journalists who had prepared the usual provocative questions. Later that afternoon, a 150-strong meeting was organised for Chavez in the House of Commons, hosted by Colin Burgon MP and the Labour Friends of Venezuela. Together with John McDonnell MP and Jeremy Corbyn MP, HOV was represented by Alan Woods, Rob Sewell and Jeremy Dear. Watched over by a scowling bust of Winston Churchill, Chavez gave the most militant speech ever heard in the august surroundings of the Palace of Westminster. In general lines it was similar to the one he had given at the TUC, dealing with the history of the liberation struggle in Venezuela, the evils of capitalism and the socialist road that needed to be taken. But he addressed himself specifically to the Labour Party and its socialist and working class traditions: ""We know where the Labour Party has come from and its traditions"", said Chavez, ""and we fully identify with these traditions."" He continued: ""I do not wish to refer to the internal politics of Britain, but you have all heard something called the ‘Third Way'"", he said, in a clear reference to the ideas of Tony Blair. ""My experience has convinced me that there is no third way between capitalism and socialism. The only way forward for humanity is socialism. Chavez then went on to explain that ""they try to frighten us with the power of the Empire, but we are not frightened. There is a bigger power than imperialism and that is world public opinion, and by that I mean the power of the people of the world. We must not restrict our activity to the streets. We must take power."" This is the first time for generations that a person has given a speech in the Mother of Parliaments stressing socialism and world revolution. It was very warmly received and it clearly made a profound impact on those present, especially when President Chavez described the events of the coup in April 2002. ""I thought I was going to die that day. In fact, they tried to kill me three times but were stopped by the soldiers guarding me. Finally, we were rescued by the people"", he said. Afterwards he was introduced to John McDonnell of HOV and warmly shook his hand: ""Thank you John MacDonnell for everything you have done. Thank you. Thank you"", the President said in English. After this, we proceeded to the welcoming rally outside the Banqueting Hall in Whitehall, where a large group had congregated to meet the President. This was the last meeting of the visit, aimed primarily at the business community and the need to encourage investment in the Venezuelan economy. This time, the welcoming rally was met with a small opposition gathering of some 10 people, made up of middle class types. They were completely outnumbered and looked a pathetic bunch. When Chavez arrived, the crowd surged forward and swamped the President. Again he took time to thank everyone and shake hands and embrace his supporters. As he went in to the entrance, the crowd simply followed him. After a pause, the President's team urged us to come in and join the meeting. Dozens of HOV supporters were allowed in. To the astonishment of the staff of Canning House, young people in jeans and denim jackets joined the likes of Norman Lamont and other doyens of the bourgeoisie, who were clearly curious to hear what this man was going to say. Many of us took seats at the front next to the Venezuelan delegation. Chavez again greeted us with handshakes and salutes, especially Alan Woods. The hall was packed with around 600 present. Chavez mounted the podium with the defiant air of Daniel in the lion's den. He handled himself very skilfully, treating his audience to a barrage of carefully mobilised statistics to rebut, one after another, the lies and slanders against the Bolivarian Revolution. As usual, he spoke without notes, only occasionally reading some statistics from voluminous sheets of paper. He began by enumerating the successes of the Bolivarian Revolution. He pointed out that for the first time Unicef had declared Venezuela free of illiteracy. 60% used to attend school, but now the figure is over 75%. Education spending is up to 8% of the GDP, the same as healthcare: ""We are promoting health, employment and education,"" said Chavez. ""We have diagnostic centres and people can go there free, thanks to Cuba. We have 20,000 Cuban doctors and assistants in Venezuela ensuring primary healthcare. In the last three years there have been 117 million visits to the surgeries and 16.8 million to the dentists. Thousands of people have had their lives saved due to these measures. We have had 200,000 operations for cataracts, a 15 minute operation that allows people to see properly. I have had people cry in front of me because they thought that they would never see a dawn or the moon again. Health is a right for the poor as much as the rich,"" said Chavez. ""Why should it not be? You must not privatise health. Health is a right for everyone!"" The country's international reserves had grown from $10b three years ago to $30.4b today. Unemployment has been halved and will soon be in single figures. Inflation has fallen from 100% plus to around 10%. The GDP has grown over nine consecutive quarters, demonstrating vigorous growth, and not only in the oil sector. There were major projects being planned in regard to infrastructure which needed international investment, he said. We do not know whether this speech will lead to greater investments by the British capitalists in Venezuela. This depends on what is stronger: their greed for profits or their fear of the Revolution. On the way out, one man dressed in a posh suit was heard to say that his money would be safer elsewhere. In any case, President Chavez can be under no illusion that the real friends of the Bolivarian Revolution are not the smart audience in the banqueting hall but the workers, trade unionists and youth of Britain. After the meeting, Chavez made his way out of the building, making his way slowly through the ranks of cheering supporters. Thus ended a very successful visit, which has undoubtedly served to consolidate the solidarity movement, especially Hands off Venezuela, and strengthen the forces of the Left in the British labour and trade union movement. It has put the question of socialism and revolution back on the agenda of the British labour movement in a way that could not have been foreseen even a few years ago. History is not finished, it has only just begun. ",NA,NA

													National Radio of Venezuela"," During the opening speech given to representatives of the British trade unions, the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez Frias reiterated that the main reason for his visit to London was to give thanks for the gestures of solidarity that have been organised by the different social organisations in Britain, the TUC prominent amongst them. Chavez recalled the historically important role of the European working class in the fundamental transformations of the economic and social systems that developed from transcendental movements such as the Industrial and French revolutions. He said “that Miranda and Bolivar were highly inspired here in London”. He pointed out in his historic speech that capitalism was born as the system that came to implement the exploitation of the citizens over their labour in inhumane conditions. However, he emphasised that with it was born an alternative to this system, a thread of thought that influenced the world community. In the same way in England during the Industrial Revolution ideological currents developed into what became Scientific Socialism today. “At the beginning of the 21 st century we need to re-examine the only thesis that can allow us to change the course of the world to save it: socialism”. He reiterated the proposal of creating a network of workers between the labour movements of Venezuela and United Kingdom, with the target of opening up cooperation in the same way that has been done amongst the peoples of South America, the Caribbean and even amongst the poor layers in the United States. He said that the strengthening of the relations should also include other areas such as education, culture and health. He explained that in the case of the UK this cooperation should also take place in the energy industry. He asked for help from the British trade unions to design models of exchange that could be agreed upon. President Chavez said that in Venezuela the people are guaranteed the right to health thanks to the efforts of the Bolivarian government but also above all thanks to the support of the Cuban Revolution which has sent more than 20,000 doctors to Venezuela’s poorest communities. He also referred to the construction of 600 medical support centres throughout the country, equipped with high-tech equipment. “I have a total and full respect for the autonomy of the workers’ movement,” he said. At the same time he highlighted the 400% increase in trade union membership in Venezuela as proof of the openness of the government towards the involvement of workers. When he was consulted about the declarations of representatives of other countries accusing him of involvement in their internal affairs, he expressed his sympathy for Ollanta Humala, the presidential candidate in Peru. He also said that Alan Garcia belongs to the desperate right wing. He said that “the desperation of the right wing explains the accusations against us that we are using ‘petrodollars’ to buy off the will of other countries. We respect the self-determination of the people as something holy, but we have the right to express our opinions.” He added that the US government, with its imperial dollars, is trying to buy the people and use war and violence when it does not get what it wants. Finally, he answered a question referring to allegations of attacks against the press, “there has never been so much press freedom in Venezuela”. May 15, 2006 From www.rnv.gov.ve ",NA,NA

													Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias"," London, 14 May (ABN) More than 200 supporters of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign in London, England, welcomed the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez Frías, on his visit to the United Kingdom this Saturday, May 14. Esperanza Espigares, one of the members of the organisation in London and member of the Reception Committee for the Latin American Head of State, expressed the words of welcome. Espigares explained that the organisation worked to prepare this rally in order to show their support for the Venezuelan Head of State as well as for the Bolivarian process which he is leading. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign, which has representatives in more than 20 countries around the world, is working to explain the truth about Venezuela and to build positive support for the changes that are taking place in Venezuela. Espigares also dealt with the attitude of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, in her opinion, “has no right to tell Venezuela what President Chávez should do”. In any case, she said, Blair should take note of the positive social policies that are being introduced by the President, such as Barrio Adentro, Robinson, and others. As a member of the Reception Committee for the Venezuelan President, she was confident that people in the trade unions firmly support the President. To prove this point, she explained that the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign was responsible for resolutions passed at many trade union conferences, which pledged support for the revolutionary process in Venezuela. She specified that the campaign being waged by Hands Off Venezuela has succeeded in linking the trade unions in Britain with the confederation of trade unions in Venezuela (UNT), which in her opinion is proof of the great strides forward that “we are taking”.

After the film, Alex Grant of Hands off Venezuela gave a brief history of the situation in Venezuela. Those present joined in a discussion about the events taking place in Venezuela. Discussion focused on the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba, and the meaning of “Socialism of the 21  Century.” Many DVD's and other materials were sold and enough money was raised to pay for the room and contribute to organizing our next event. Contacts were made such as from the Council of Canadians who expressed a desire to work together on some future Venezuelan solidarity events. Representatives from the Venezuelan Embassy were also present.  The launching event of HOV Ottawa was a success and helped to further the Venezuelan solidarity movement in Canada, our next event can only build on this success.

			Vienna, May 12: Hugo Chávez addresses mass rally organised by Hands off Venezuela!",2006-05-13T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Last night at the Arena cultural centre in Vienna, President Chavez spoke to an audience of 5,000 enthusiastic young people in a mass meeting organised by Hands off Venezuela and Cuba , the Austrian section of the HOV international solidarity campaign that is now active in more than 30 countries. The meeting was a spectacular success. It was the biggest public meeting held by the Left in Vienna for as long as most people can remember. Peter Kreisky, the son of the former Chancellor of Austria, Bruno Kreisky, said he could not remember anything like this for 30 years. The rally, which was called to coincide with the EU Summit on Latin America, was set to start at 6.30pm. But because of unforeseen difficulties, the President was delayed for several hours and the rally finally began at 10 pm. Since many people had already started queuing at 5pm, this meant a very long wait! Nevertheless, the mood was vibrant and good humoured throughout, and the crowd passed the time chanting, singing and waving a sea of red banners. The capacity of the meeting hall in the Arena is about 800, but at the last moment the management decided to impose a maximum of 400 on grounds of safety. The organisers, with the help of the Casa Militar (the Presidential security team) had already fixed up a big screen outside in the spacious courtyard, so that many more people could watch the proceedings outside. In the event, everything had to be changed. As time passed, more and more people kept arriving. The hall was filled before the doors were opened and hundreds of people – overwhelmingly youth – poured into the courtyard. The organisers began to calculate numbers – a thousand, two thousand, three thousand. Soon the place was full, literally to the rooftops. Even the police estimated 3,000. In fact there were at least 5,000 in the precinct, and several hundreds more who could not get in and had to stay on the street. It was fortunate that the start of the meeting was delayed because all the arrangements had to be scrapped. The tribune was moved outside on a balcony facing the courtyard and a sound system was hastily rigged up by the staff of the Arena, who were very helpful. There was a nervous moment at the start because the word was put out that the President would not attend the meeting. It was true that, because of a very hectic agenda at the Summit, it was extremely difficult for him to come to the meeting, but the day before he had told the organisers; “I know about this meeting and will do everything in my power to be there.” And he kept his word. At about a quarter to ten the presidential car swept into the precinct and Chavez stepped onto the platform amidst a storm of applause. On the platform there were many prominent figures in the Bolivarian Movement. Nicolas Maduro, the President of the National Assembly, Juan Barreto, the mayor of Caracas, as well as the Minister of Planning, Jorge Giordani and Eva Gollinger, the author of The Chavez Code . Ruben Linares, one of the national co-ordinators of the UNT, was also present, as was the Cuban ambassador and a group of 20 Cubans from the embassy and the Instituto Cubano de Amistad de los Pueblos. A number of high-ranking officials of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) were also present. The meeting was chaired by a young shop steward and member of HOV, Axel Magnus. Apart from Chavez, there were only two speakers: Aleida Guevara, the daughter of Che Guevara, and Alan Woods, founder of the international Hands Off Venezuela campaign, who sat on either side of the President. Aleida opened the meeting with an impassioned speech, in which she recalled the heroic struggle of her father and which she urged the youth to continue. She laid particular emphasis on the campaign to free the five Cubans illegally being held in US prisons. For the benefit of the many Latin Americans in the audience, Alan Woods addressed the meeting in Spanish. He started his speech, which was interrupted by frequent and enthusiastic applause, by remarking: “And they say there is apathy among the youth! Welcome, apathetic youngsters! (laughter and applause). The youth are not apathetic! The youth need a cause that is worthy of them, a banner, a vision and a dream!” He went on to quote the (in)famous statement by Francis Fukuyama that history has ended: “History has not ended. This is history. They are making history in Venezuela. And you are making history.” Alan continued: “There are many meetings in Vienna right now. But there is no meeting like this one. We have not come here just to talk and then go home and forget about things. This meeting must be the launching pad for organising a great movement of solidarity in every country in Europe.” He appealed to all present to join HOV. To judge from the response of those present, this appeal did not fall on deaf ears. Alan was followed by Emanuel Tomaselli, the national organiser of HOV (Austria) who briefly introduced President Chavez. He said: “Life is a struggle and today we have won a battle. On the one hand, it was very difficult to assure the presence of President Chavez at this meeting. On the other hand, it was very easy, because we always knew that he would prefer to be here with the revolutionary youth than to dine with the Presidents who are fooling their own peoples.” When President Chavez approached the podium he was greeted with deafening applause and a sea of waving red flags and chanting, He spoke for about two hours, and his main theme was the need to fight against imperialism and capitalism that are destroying the planet and placing the human race in danger. He quoted the words of Rosa Luxemburg: “The choice before humanity is socialism or barbarism.” And he added; “When Rosa Luxemburg made this statement, she was speaking of a relatively distant future. But now the situation of the world is so bad that the threat to the human race is not in the future, but now.” He went on: “When I was a kid of 15 we had May 1968, the Beatles, John Lennon and the war in Vietnam. We looked to the future and we thought that by the year 2000, the world would be a different place, a better place. But the years have passed and instead of improving things have got much worse. What has happened? They have stolen my future. Imperialism and capitalism have stolen my future. And now that I am in my fifties, I am convinced that people of my generation must spend every day, every hour, every minute of our lives fighting for a better world – a world free from poverty, inequality and injustice. That world is called socialism! I believe that only the youth have the necessary enthusiasm, the passion, the fire, to make the revolution. Let us unite to save the world. Together we can succeed!” The President’s speech was received with wild applause and the cheering and chanting went on for a long time, as he took a red flag from one of the audience and waved it in the air. Then, quite spontaneously, the crowd started to sing the Internationale. It was an emotional end to an emotional occasion. It was past midnight and for hours later groups of people were still standing in the precinct, discussing the ideas of socialism and revolution in a way that has not been seen here for many years. A huge amount of effort was put into organising this meeting. A total of 7,000 posters were put up by HOV activists all over Austria, to advertise the meeting. A very active role was also played by the Austrian Young Socialists and the Alternative students, who, in contrast to others in the Alternative movement, actively backed this meeting and participated with energy and enthusiasm. There are many people we would like to thank for their help and assistance in organising this meeting. Unfortunately there are too many to name them all. We would like to thank comrade Harold from the Casa Militar, Veronica from the Venezuelan embassy in Vienna and Alejandro Fleming, the Venezuelan ambassador in Belgium and to the European Union. We would also like to thank comrade Fernando Bossi in Caracas for his invaluable assistance in arranging this activity. Unfortunately, not everyone shared the enthusiasm for this meeting. Some of the organisers of the so-called Alternative Summit clearly wanted to impose a monopoly on the visit of President Chavez. Despite repeated attempts of HOV to achieve unity, every approach was met with a rebuff. Once again, unfortunately, the Left suffered from the traditional disease of sectarianism and disunity. The conduct of some of the opponents of HOV can only be described as sabotage. All kind of irresponsible rumours about HOV were put in circulation and a malicious campaign of misinformation was launched. Matters came to an extreme when the former head of the Austrian CP, Walter Beier, on the eve of our meeting, stated in the pages of The Standard , one of the main papers, that the idea that President Chavez would speak at this meeting was “nonsense”. In fact, the rumour was widely circulated that the president would not come. As late as 11 pm the television was reporting that President Chavez had returned to his hotel. At that time he was half way through his speech at the Arena! All kinds of other obstacles were placed in the way, which we will not bother to enumerate. It is sufficient to say that all the strenuous efforts to boycott the HOV meeting ended in an abysmal failure. The meeting was an outstanding success. At the end of his speech, President Chavez publicly thanked Alan Woods and Hands off Venezuela for having organised such an outstanding meeting. The message is plain; it is time to put an end to the disunity, to stop trying to marginalise HOV – the oldest and by far the most successful campaign of solidarity with Venezuela, and the only solidarity campaign of an international nature. It is necessary to put aside secondary differences and unite in action to defend the Venezuelan Revolution against its external and internal enemies. That was, and still is, the position of HOV and we invite all those who sincerely value the cause of the Revolution to join with us in common struggle from now on. The rally of May 12 will be of enormous international significance, particularly since Austria currently holds the presidency of the European Union. Media from all over the world were present: over 60 newspapers, press agencies and TV companies were there. In Venezuela the meeting received the widest coverage imaginable. Here in Vienna the press reported that Chavez had made an extremely radical speech calling for revolution and socialism. The ruling class and their hired press are most unhappy, but the workers and youth of Austria and the rest of Europe are delighted. Imperialism is not just the USA. The EU has been pursuing an increasingly hostile foreign policy towards Cuba and has condemned last week’s measures by Evo Morales to take control of Bolivia’s hydrocarbon resources. It is no secret that Europe’s strategists of capital share Washington’s “concerns” about the swing to the left in one Latin American country after another. Because of this it was important to show that there is a different Europe as well – that ordinary working people and students support the cause of the Bolivarian Revolution and of socialism in Europe and the whole world. This historic meeting was a giant step forward for international socialism. Vienna, 13 th May. Note: For other reports (in Spanish), see VTV , ABN , MinCI , Prensa Latina , Cuba , Terra , España .

			""Hands off Venezuela"" welcomes Chávez in Vienna",2006-05-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands off Venezuela, Austria - www.haendewegvonvenezuela.org"," President Chávez arrived in Vienna yesterday, May 11, ahead of the EU-Latin America summit which takes place today. However, Hugo Chávez will not only be speaking with Europe's ""high society"" and political leaders. He will also be speaking to the workers and youth of Austria. Last night around 200 activists welcomed him with a militant ""¡Rumbo al socialismo!"" – ""Forward to socialism!"" In the short space of a few days activists of the Hands off Venezuela campaign, the socialist youth and the Marxist tendency Der Funke , as well as a number of other supporters of Chávez organised a militant demonstration to show their solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. After giving several short interviews to the press, Chávez turned to the activists who had come out to greet him chanting revolutionary slogans such as ""El pueblo unido, jamás será vencido!"" and ""¡Rumbo, rumbo, rumbo! ¡Rumbo al socialismo!"" Chávez raised his fist to the crowd in salute. He then spoke to Emanuel Tomaselli, the co-ordinator of the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Austria. Chávez said: ""The poor, the workers, the women - in the 21 st century, these suppressed layers of society will put into practice the ideals of my youth of the 1960s."" He went on to greet Alan Woods, the editor of www.marxist.com and the leading figure of the International Marxist Tendency, as well as the Venezuelan trade unionist Rubén Linares of the UNT. He confirmed his presence at the Hands off Venezuela and Cuba rally tonight in the Arena Wien in Vienna. Over the previous few days all main Austrian newspapers carried articles on Hands off Venezuela and announced tonight's meeting. Hugo Chávez, Alan Woods, Aleida Guevara and Rubén Linares will address the rally. Due to the high public interest in the event a large video screen will be placed in front of the building which will bring the rally to the people who will have to stay outside. More than 50 journalists from all over the world will be present and cover the meeting. This rally could mean a major breakthrough for the solidarity movement with the Bolivarian revolution in Austria.

			Successful meeting with Jorge Martin in Vancouver",2006-05-16T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Canada"," On Tuesday 9th May the Jorge Martin speaking tour stopped in Vancouver, Canada. 85 people packed into the room to hear Tamara Hansen (Coordinator of Vancouver Communities in Solidarity with Cuba) and Jorge Martin (International Secretary of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign) speak at a forum titled “Hands Off Venezuela and Cuba!” The room was filled over capacity forcing some to stand at the back of the room or sit in the aisles. Tamara outlined the fantastic social gains made by the Cuban revolution and poked fun at the hypocrisy of the American government which fights its so-called “War on Terrorism” while harboring Cuban terrorist Luis Posada Carriles. She also stressed the importance of defending Cuba from imperialist aggression and capitalist restoration. Jorge Martin spoke in detail about the developing revolution in Venezuela and the advance of the worker and peasant movements throughout Latin America. Jorge drew an enthusiastic round of applause when he explained that there is no third way; there is no such thing as a nicer, friendlier capitalism. He finished by saying that the best way we could help the Venezuelan and Cuban revolutions is to fight for socialism in Canada. This was followed by a lively discussion and question period. The large attendance at this meeting shows that the Latin American revolution is a topic that is attracting a lot of attention. The keen crowd raised over $200 to help pay for the cost of the Jorge Martin speaking tour. This bodes well for the future of the solidarity movement in Vancouver. ",NA,NA

			Belgium: New hope for the left at day of solidarity with Venezuelan revolution",2006-05-09T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Handen af van Venezuela"," Organising an activity during the Easter weekend is risky business. A low turnout is almost guaranteed. A hundred participants would have been a great success for our solidarity initiative. In the end some 131 persons paid their entry and at least twenty others came in after this. The Bolivarian revolution has apparently struck a chord in the hearts of the left in Flanders! The Hands Off Venezuela campaign took the initiative to bring together 17 different organisations including different socialist unions with the aim of organising a day of solidarity with the revolution in Venezuela. One of those unions, the “Algemene Centrale”, which organises building workers, as well as chemical and oil workers and many others, offered its premises for the event. The hall was decorated with all kinds of Bolivarian and revolutionary posters and banners. Information stalls of the local Salvador Allende Committee, a group organising poor people in Antwerp; PSC Open Huis, a left-wing peace organisation; Vrede, Initiativa Cuba Socialista, the HOV campaign and Vonk were present. The Hands Off Venezuela and Vonk stall attracted a lot of attention and collected 241.50 Euros thanks to the sale of brochures, DVD's, T-shirts, badges but also Marxist classics and the paper Vonk . The composition of the participants was remarkably diverse: young people and retired workers, activists of the broad left movement, from the workers' movement, from the organised poor. The union that hosted our activity had sent different trade union leaders and many shop stewards from the chemical and oil refinery plants: Total, Degussa, Bayer and Agfa Gevaert. The Latin American continent was also well represented with people from Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile. Some seventy people left their addresses to be informed about the activities of Hands Off Venezuela. One of the leaders of the hosting union, Danny Pauwels, explained why his union opened its doors for such initiatives. “The union,” he said, “should do more than just defend the workers on the floor. The union organisation has a general task of political education and also a social responsibility in regard to its members and activists.” Then Nick Deschacht explained the planning of the day and introduced the screening of the famous documentary The Revolution will not be televised made by Kim Bartley and Donnacha O’Brian, two Irish journalists who happened to be in the middle of the military coup d’état in April 2002 against president Hugo Chavez. The Wall Street Journal described Venezuela and Chavez as “Washington’s greatest Latin American nightmare together with the old headache of Cuba”. Possibly this was also the shortest coup d’état in history as in 48 hours Chavez was back in power. However, very few people drew correct conclusions from it. What appeared to be a classical Latin American coup, differed from the other operetta like coups in that it vanished very rapidly thanks to the active and massive support of the overwhelming majority of the population for Chavez. Although the sabotage of the official state television made the broadcasting of anything impossible, and even though Chavez’s advisers had made no call to the population, hundreds of thousands filled the streets and forced the right-wing coup leaders to surrender. The documentary was followed by an enthusiastic eyewitness report given by Maya Wuytack who participated in the World Youth Festival in Venezuela. Maya is the daughter of Frans Wuytack, who developed an activity as a workers' priest in the poor slums of Caracas in 1966. Maya is writing a book describing the experiences of her father in Venezuela. Her brother Fabio is also making a film on the Bolivarian revolution. After a short break, the new Venezuelan ambassador, Alejandro Fleming, started by thanking everybody for organising the solidarity event. “On the 11 th of April a small minority revolted against the Bolivarian government. This is a minority which in the past always had power in its hands. The people succeeded in overthrowing the dictatorship and reintroducing democracy. But not just any democracy, but a participative democracy where the people exercise power themselves”. The audience then listened to different testimonies of people who have had first hand experience of the Bolivarian revolution. The debate was led by Georges Spriet of the left-wing peace organisation, Vrede. First to speak was Wouter Van Damme of Comac. He visited Venezuela during the World Youth Festival with some 30 other youth during the summer of 2005. He started with a socio-economic description of Venezuela, the oil rich country with enormous resources, whose benefits were controlled by the private sector. Later he explained how the government of Chavez was freeing itself from its economic dependency on the USA. Erik Demeester outlined the aims of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign: to seek support for the Bolivarian revolution inside the international labour movement and to spread accurate and correct information. He provided a lively description of the revolutionary process as a conscious participation of the masses in politics, through an enormous urge to organise from the bottom up and the increasing consciousness amongst the poor, the workers and women. On the other hand he described the attempts of the bourgeoisie and the right wing to sabotage and destroy the economy. Chavez reacts to this by expropriating companies closed down by their owners and by placing them under workers' control. This process is a living laboratory for socialist experiments, which the international labour movement should follow closely. Erik concluded by pointing out the importance of the evolution in the thinking of Chavez. “In 1998 Chavez toyed with the idea of organising a meeting about Tony Blair's Third Way. On the basis of his experience, however, he realised that there is no such thing as ‘capitalism with a human face’. Now he says we should enter the road of socialism while studying the classics in a critical way. Which government official nowadays dares to talk about socialism?” Xavier Declerq, General Secretary of Oxfam Solidariteit, and Francine Mestrum of ATTAC took part in the World Social Forum that took place in Caracas January 2006. They clearly came back full of inspiration. Xavier was asked to give some more explanation about the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba. He explained how since the start of the Bolivarian revolution both countries have forged strong links, both economically and in terms of solidarity. He also had a question about this for the Venezuelan ambassador, who gave a very interesting reply. According to Alejandro Fleming we cannot approach the collaboration between Venezuela and Cuba from a purely economic point of view. He gave the example of “mision Milagro”, a government backed program in which people with eye problems can be treated in Cuban hospitals, allowing them to see better again. “So the economic integration is in favour of the people.” Then he pointed out that Venezuela is breaking with a lot of schemes, for example with representative democracy. “In Venezuela we go a step further with participatory democracy in which the people participate in politics much more actively. Also the socialism we are proposing breaks with the old schemes. It is the socialism of the 21 st century. We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. You have to read the classics and draw lessons from the past. We do not want to impose a model.” Finally Francine Mestrum gave a gripping report about the first achievements of the Bolivarian revolution: illiteracy has disappeared in a few years, everywhere in the poor neighbourhoods medical care is provided for in collaboration with Cuban doctors. According to Francine, Venezuela proves that alternative policies are possible. “I think that message is the most important.” She referred to the so-called Millennium Goals with which the United Nations want to halve poverty by the year 2015. It is clear already they won't achieve this goal “while the Millennium Goals are very modest in comparison with the achievements in Venezuela in just a few years time!” She explained that the Venezuelan government realises that all kinds of social needs like education, healthcare, good water supplies, etc., cannot be separated from each other. What is the point of getting a good education if you have got no potable water? Besides, Chavez also links social development to economical development, for instance by giving land to the poor peasants. By way of conclusions Francine wanted to emphasize that Chavez has done something very important with the anti-globalisation movement: he has politicised it. “And I can only hope this will continue!” The applause showed that the audience was in full agreement. From the floor there were some interesting contributions. Erik De Bruyn pointed out that we can see development aid from south to north. Venezuela gives us hope and provides us with socialist experiments. Somebody posed the question of how we can avoid a defeat like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The panel answered from different angles. Erik Demeester concluded that the Trojan Horse in particular needs to be removed: the capitalist state apparatus and the private ownership of the industry, through which the capitalists can continually boycott the economy. In the end Wim Benda appealed to unite the left and the labour movement around the Bolivarian revolution. This solidarity is necessary for the self-defence of the revolution because a defeat in Venezuela would lead to demoralisation all over the world. “But also because we have to break the bank of capitalism somewhere. In Venezuela there is a chance to defeat capitalism. We have to take this opportunity with both hands!” The Cuban ambassador, Elio Eduardo Rodríguez Perdomo, said that the future of Cuba is linked with the future of Venezuela, Latin America and the whole Third World. Solidarity with Venezuela thus means solidarity with Cuba. In his farewell speech Gust Haverbeke, regional secretary of ACOD Limburg [the socialist trade union], dealt with the importance of Venezuela for the Belgian trade union movement. He regrets that in the trade union too many people have to fall back on corporatism and refuse to look further than their trade unions. This is in sharp contrast with the activists. “When you explain that stress at work, reorganisations, etc., are caused by globalisation, people start to show solidarity and you will see them on demonstrations.” The fact that the Head Office of Antwerpen-Waasland supports the day of solidarity with Venezuela, gives Gust hope that there is room for more of these initiatives in the whole ABVV. He explained that ACOD Limburg had already elected Chavez as honorary president. For him “the trade unions have to promote the Bolivarian revolution. In the south there are people who want to break with imperialism and capitalism. That gives me hope and as a trade union we have to support this!” April 2006 ",NA,NA

			Three hundred people attend “Hands Off Venezuela!” seminar at European Social Forum",2006-05-10T00:00:00Z,"
															
													the Greek Committee of “Hands off Venezuela!”"," On Friday, May 7, the Greek Hands Off Venezuela! committee, together with the German group Network Cuba and the Marxist journal Marxistiki Foni , organised an important seminar on the “Bolivarian Revolution and Socialism of 21 st Century” at the 4 th European Social Forum in Athens. The 300-capacity hall where the seminar was held was almost full, mostly young people. This big attendance reflects the big interest that exists among the youth and the workers of Europe in the Bolivarian Revolution. Also it reflects the excellent work of the Greek HOV committee and of the supporters of Marxistiki Foni who had organised a special coordination meeting to prepare the seminar and in the week prior to the event they had given out thousands of leaflets all over Athens announcing the seminar. The first speaker of the seminar was Victor Chirinos, the Vice president of the Venezuelan parliament. He gave an historical overview of the Bolivarian Revolution, emphasising to the conquests of the revolution. After Chirinos, Kiomara Tortoza, a cadre of the solidarity group Salon protagoniko explained the role of imperialism in the attempt to undermine the Bolivarian Revolution. The third speaker was Carlos Oliva, a Cuban cadre of ALBA, who emphasized the role of Cuba as a point of reference in the progressive developments all over Latin America. The next speaker was the intellectual and advisor to Chavez, Heinz Dietrich who support his theories on “socialism of the 21st century”, but by trying to convince the audience that the main point of the movement in Latin America is the conquest of a welfare state like this the one that exists in Europe! The representative of Marxistiki Foni and of the Greek Hands off Venezuela! Committee, Stamatis Karayannopoulos opposed the reformist theories of Dietrich by quoting and defending the words of Hugo Chavez who had officially stated one year ago that there is no place for a “humanitarian” capitalism and that socialism is the only solution for the masses in Latin America. “We must defend the big conquests of the Bolivarian Revolution, but is not in the interests of the revolution to transform the faults and weakness of the revolution into a model for the people of the world. The best support for the Bolivarian Revolution is to understand that to support the task of the completion of the revolution needs moving to the socialist tasks and the fight to internationalise the socialist revolutionary process all over Latin America and all over the world”. These were the words of Stamatis Karayannopoulos who received a big applause from the audience, but also provoked ironic smiles on the part of Dietrich and a few noisy supporters of his opinions in the audience. Also, a very important contribution in the discussion was offered by the coordinator of the student section of Hands Off Venezuela! in Greece, Panagiotis Kolovos. He explained the vital role of the labour movement in the revolution by reporting on many examples of factories that have been taken over and are developing under workers’ control, proving the possibilities of the workers to run the whole economy. It was unfortunate that the few supporters (2 or 3) of Dietrich’s opinions constantly interrupted the young speaker, helped by the chair of the seminar Kristine Karch from Network Cuba , who, under the pressure of an overwhelming majority of the audience, finally let the member of HOV speak and explain his opinions. After the speakers from the panel there was an interesting discussion in the seminar. Evi Tounda, a student supporter of Marxistiki Foni explained the role of the international HOV campaign all over the world by reporting the many successful actions of the campaign. There was a very good intervention by Amilkar Figueroa, an old cadre of the Venezualan socialist movement, who spoke with enthusiasm about the discussion that has opened up on socialism in Venezuela and about the revolutionary fervour that is gripping the masses in Venezuela. At the end of the seminar dozens of people left their addresses and phone numbers expressing their wish to participate actively in the HOV campaign and they also bought HOV material. The seminar was yet another successful event organized by the HOV campaign, proving that this campaign is the most creative and enthusiastic solidarity campaign in defence of the Bolivarian revolution all over the world.

													Espe Espigares"," Hands Off Venezuela made a very good intervention in May Day. At the beginning of the march in Clerkenwell, a large stall was set up behind a massive HOV banner selling literature and t-shirts. The new HOV magazine was on sale throughout the demonstration. Activists were keen to sell the magazine and trade unionists took orders for their branches. At the rally in Trafalgar Square, the stall was again set up and attracted a lot of interest. The Hands Off Venezuela meeting following the May Day march and rally in London was very successful. Over 100 people filled a church hall to hear Jorge Martin, the international secretary of HOV, speak about the Bolivarian Revolution and the struggle for workers’ control. Rob Sewell of the national steering committee introduced the meeting and welcomed everyone on international labour day. In his speech, Jorge Martin explained how the working class had become involved in the Revolution after the April 2002 coup and the bosses’ lockout. In particular, the sabotage of the oil industry, the biggest industry in Venezuela, had forced the workers to take over PDVSA and run it for themselves. For some 67 days the oil industry was run without bosses and under workers’ control. This provided a great example to other workers who had occupied their workplaces. New examples were given of workers’ control in Venepal, Alcasa, Inveval, and elsewhere. A lively discussion took place with questions and contributions from the floor. Dozens of people signed to get involved in the HOV campaign and many were keen to participate in the welcoming rallies for President Chavez planned for later this month. The collection raised £80 towards the costs of the meeting. Listen to Jorge Martin's speech here and here . ",NA,NA

													Hands off Venezuela, Austria"," President Chavez will be the major speaker at a Hands off Venezuela and Cuba event which will take place at the “Arena” in Vienna, Austria this Friday, May 12. The rally is set to start at 6.30pm. Together with Chavez, Alan Woods (founder of the international Hands Off Venezuela campaign), Ruben Linares (one of the national co-ordinators of the UNT, Venezuela) and Aleida Guevara (the daughter of Che Guevara) will be addressing the meeting. A number of high-ranking officials of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) will also be present. A total of 7,000 posters will be put up by our activists all over Austria, to advertise the meeting. As Austria currently holds the presidency of the European Union, the rally will be of enormous international significance. Media from all over the world will be present. The EU has been pursuing an increasingly hostile foreign policy towards Cuba and has condemned last week’s measures by Evo Morales to take control of Bolivia’s hydrocarbon resources. It is no secret that Europe’s strategists of capital share Washington’s “concerns” about the swing to the left in one Latin American country after another. Because of this it is important to show that there is a different Europe as well – that ordinary working people and students support the cause of the Bolivarian Revolution. Friday’s rally is the peak of a series of events that will take place this week. Ruben Linares of the UNT will speak at Hands Off Venezuela meetings in Linz (May 8), at a rally for trade unionists in Vienna (May 10), and in Graz (May 15). He is going to visit a number of factories, address a union conference, talk to leading trade union officials and speak to the international committee of the ÖGB. This could be a major step forward in the campaign for the recognition of the UNT by Austria’s trade union federation. Details about these and other events can be found at www.haendewegvonvenezuela.org . In addition to this, the latest edition of the theoretical magazine Aufstand der Vernunft of Der Funke (the Marxist tendency in Austria and Germany) will be launched this week. It contains articles on the perspectives for the Bolivarian and the Cuban Revolutions, an answer to the sectarians’ allegations of Chávez’s “bonapartism”, an analysis of Venezuela’s cogestión , a balance sheet of workers’ self management in Yugoslavia, a critique of Heinz Dieterich’s views of socialism, an interview with Alan Woods on Venezuela and Cuba, as well as an article by Alan Woods on agrarian reform in Venezuela.

Chavez will be returning from the EU Latin America/Caribbean summit, which takes place in Vienna a few days earlier. In London, Chavez will be greeted by Hands Off Venezuela activists and supporters who have been waiting anxiously for a long time for this visit. Chavez’s programme in London will include a meeting with the London mayor, a press conference and meetings with supportive members of Parliament and with leading members of the British trade unions, which are preparing their first official delegation to Venezuela. President Chavez’s visit is particularly important because of all the hard work of the British solidarity movement over the last three years in defending the Venezuelan Revolution. This is particularly the case after Tony Blair's recent attack on Chavez in the House of Commons. ""This will be a fantastic occassion”, stated Jorge Martin, the international secretary of Hands Off Venezuela. ""This visit by Hugo Chavez will bring Venezuela up the political agenda and give a tremendous boost to the solidarity campaign."" The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign will be in the forefront of promoting this visit. The visit coincides with the launch of the new colour HOV magazine , which will be energetically sold in particular throughout Chavez's stay. During Chavez’s visit, Hands Off Venezuela will be organising a public meeting on Tuesday 16th May to celebrate the visit. We will also be holding a social/screening that evening at a nearby location. ""This visit must be the launch pad to push the campaign onto a higher level"", says Rob Sewell of the HOV National Steering Committee. ""We must seize this golden opportunity with both hands!"" Following on the successful resolutions supporting Venezuela at the National Union of Students and Scottish TUC conferences , other motions supporting the Venezuelan revolution, based upon the Hands Off Venezuela model resolution, are to be discussed at the conference of USDAW (the shopworkers’ union) in Blackpool, the Communication Workers Union in Bournemouth, and the College of lecturers’ union NATHFE, all of which are taking place in May.

The NED was conceived by the Reagan Administration and subsequently created by an act of Congress in 1983. Despite being officially considered a “private” organization, the NED is funded by Congress using US tax dollars for at least 95% of its budget. We demand that they cut it off! As Alan Weinstein, an NED co-founder, told the Washington Post, “a lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.” Consider this track record – only a glimpse at the NED’s activities: • In Nicaragua, in 1990, the NED spent $20 per voter in support of a rightist presidential candidate with an agenda to crush the popular movement. Part of this money was used to saturate the media with empty promises, lies, and, most notably, the threat of a continuation of the devastating US proxy Contra war, should the US candidate lose the election. • The NED helped to overthrow governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992, and manipulated elections in Mongolia in 1996, all of which had been democratically elected. • In Venezuela, the NED quadrupled its budget leading up to the coup against the elected presidency of Hugo Chavez in 2002, defeated by a popular uprising backed by soldiers loyal to the constitution. NED money was given to the AFL-CIO’s Solidarity Center, which only a month before the coup attempt brought together the leadership of a corrupt trade union federation (CTV) with a national alliance of business (FEDECAMERAS), two groups that played a key role in the coup. The NED also funded groups behind the crippling lock-out of oil workers later that year, and funded the recall referendum against Chavez in 2004 — which he handsomely defeated despite NED interference. • In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where years of war have killed five million people, the NED spends about $1.5 million a year. These wars are maintained and exacerbated by Western corporate interests hungering for the DRC's rich wealth of resources. • In Haiti, the International Republican Institute (IRI), one of the NED’s core groups, funded, convened, and coordinated organizations behind the overthrow of the elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. These organizations included owners of sweatshop industries, right wing politicos, former members and associates of death squads and brutal ex-military officers. Since that coup, over 10,000 Haitians have died. The AFL-CIO’s Solidarity Center has only supported a labor organization that agitated for the ousting of Aristide, while failing to act against or condemn the massive persecution of grassroots Haitians, the majority of whom support Aristide. • In Iraq, 50% of the NED’s current budget is spent supporting the US occupation. In the name of “democracy building”, the NED funds parties, associations and union centers which are agreeable to conditions that favor US military and corporate interests. Independent union centers, for instance, are outlawed and suppressed, in defiance of the principle of workers’ free choice of representation. • In Cuba, both the IRI and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) have poured millions of dollars into efforts aimed at regime change and provocations against the Cuban people. These activities have increased exponentially under the Bush administration. • In Peru, presidential candidate Ollanta Humala is currently under attack for alleged human rights abuses by organizations receiving funding from the NED and USAID for over a decade. Humala came in first in the initial electoral round, winning the votes of the poorest people, and is an ally of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and Bolivian president Evo Morales. (Nothing was heard vs Humala until he spoke out for the poor majority.) • The NED has even funded right wing movements in Western Europe, such as France in the 1980's. The model for NED interventions was developed in the 1960s and 1970s by the AFL-CIO’s foreign “institutes”. The American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) helped the US government overthrow democratically-elected governments in Guyana and Brazil in 1964, the Dominican Republic in 1965, and most infamously Chile in 1973 – leading to the overthrow and death of President Allende and the death, torture, disappearances and exile of thousands of Chileans. The African American Labor Center (AALC) supported the apartheid regime in South Africa until 1986. The Asian American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) supported dictatorships in South Korea, The Philippines, and Indonesia. One of the NED’s first projects was to support Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the face of popular opposition – between 1983 and 1988, $5.7 million was channeled through the AAFLI to the Marcos-created Trade Union Congress, which aligned with corporate management, police and death squads against the independent trade union KMU. The NED undermines democracy at home by working against democracy around the world. STOP THE FUNDING AND CLOSE IT DOWN!!! ",NA,NA

The motion recognised the “enormous social change has taken place in Venezuela in recent years, with the government funding wide-ranging social programmes.” It pointed to the “dramatic increases in democratic participation, especially by indigenous people, women and the poor, including in eight national elections and referenda since Hugo Chavez’s election as President in 1998.” Again, it welcomed the “right to publicly funded free education including at university… (where), through literacy drives, over 1.2m Venezuelans have been taught to read and write since 1998, virtually abolishing illiteracy.” On healthcare, the resolution explained that “more than 70% of the Venezuelan population for the first time now have access to free healthcare and medicines… through ‘Operation Miracle’ is funding up to 1,500 free eye operations daily for poor people in Latin America and the Caribbean. Over six million are expected to be treated over the next decade.” The resolution concluded by opposing US military intervention in Venezuela and stressing the need to work with the trade unions and solidarity movement to provide student unions with information about education and healthcare achievements in Venezuela. Furthermore, it agreed to send a message of support to the Venezuelan Education Ministry commending the provision of free education and steps taken to eradicate illiteracy.

It seems that the United States have stepped up their campaign of pressure against Venezuela with a number of statements by Condolezza Rice and other high officials in Washington, including Director of National Security John Negroponte. In Britain this was followed by comments by Prime Minister Tony Blair questioning the democratic credentials of the Venezuelan government. There was a swift response in Parliament with Colin Burgon MP tabling an Early Day Motion which has been signed by 107 MPs. Hands Off Venezuela together with the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign organised a solidarity picket of the Venezuelan embassy , of which there is an excellent video produced by VSC, and we also issued a protest letter to Tony Blair . Following on from that the British Parliament, for the first time, held a debate on Venezuela and the relationship between Britain and the Venezuelan Revolution. Also London Mayor Ken Livingstone published a full page article in the Morning Star openly supporting Venezuela. Hands Off Venezuela also organised a successful speaking tour in the US West Coast of Luis Primo, from the National Coordination of the new trade union centre UNT (see reports in the US Hands Off Venezuela site ), participated in the anti-war demonstrations on March 18 and managed to get the National Union of Journalists to, once again, back the Bolivarian revolution and greet the new media outlets created. Unfortunately, this endorsement did not prevent a dreadful piece from being broadcasted by Channel 4 . But while this documentary presented Chavez as being a ""threat"" to the US and the ""stability of the region"", it was the US Navy which started a major military exercise in the Caribbean with the clear aim of threatening Venezuela . For all these reasons and more, the solidarity movement internationally is organising a number of activities in the week around April 13th (anniversary of the defeat of the 2002 coup against Chavez). This stretches up to April 19th which is the anniversary of the beginning of the struggle for the independence of Venezuela from Spanish Colonial rule back in 1810. We are appealing all Hands Off Venezuela supporters to organise local activities, video screenings, social gatherings and discussions, etc. We must use these dates to highlight what is really happening in Venezuela in order to counter the half-truths and open lies being spread in the corporate media. You could organise a screening of some of the documentary films on the revolution (from the classic The Revolution Will not Be Televised, to the more recent Venezuela Bolivariana), in your school, community, university, etc. Contact us if you do not know how to get a copy of these films. We can also send you leaflets and other material from the campaign that you can use. Any activities you organise, between April 8th and April 19, please let us know by writing to This email address is being protected from spambots.

													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela - www.ushov.org","On Saturday, March 25, more than 90 people came to hear Luis Primo describe the revolutionary developments that have been building momentum in Venezuela. Christina Vasquez chaired the meeting and, to the delight of the audience, affirmed solidarity with the millions of undocumented workers in the US and the huge demonstrations that have been staged across the country in defense of their rights. Bill Leumer, a member of the Teamsters’ union and former president of his International Machinists Association local, introduced Luis Primo and observed, “The message that the people of Venezuela are sending out to the world is this: If all working people and all of the poor unite, then we have the power to change the world. After all, it is working people that make the country run, it should be working people who run the country.” Primo started by giving a brief history of the CTV, the labor federation that preceded the formation of the UNT and of which he is a leading member, outlining its slow degeneration into what amounted to a bosses’ union. When the rank and file witnessed the head of the CTV actively supporting the counterrevolutionary efforts to overthrow the Chavez government by promoting the sabotage and shut down of the oil industry, they realized it was time to act. Despite the absence of most the state oil company's management and technicians, the workers themselves quickly succeeded in reestablishing oil production so that within three weeks it was almost back to its normal level. This success then led to the rank and file abandoning the CTV, and to the creation of the UNT, which is democratically controlled by the workers themselves. The UNT has been pressing for workers’ control of industry so that exploitation and dehumanization at work can finally be abolished. In describing the situation of workers under capitalist conditions, Primo noted that workers don’t really know themselves, a point that resonated with many in the audience. In other words, people go to work and basically enter a totalitarian regime. The bosses have supreme power to dictate the entire process. But in an economy operating according to humane principles, people would go to work and discuss among themselves how the work should be performed, and they would produce with the needs of the community in mind, not simply their own interests. People’s intellectual and moral faculties would be exercised, and they could begin to relate to one another as human beings, not robots. Everyone at the event seemed very pleased, and the members of the San Francisco Hands Off Venezuela, which helped organize the tour, are deeply grateful to Luis Primo for his visit.",NA,NA

													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela - www.ushov.org","Before heading back to Caracas after his multi-city West coast tour, Luis Primo, member of the expanded National Coordinating Committee of the UNT, had the opportunity to preview a new art exhibit at the Berkeley Art Museum (BAM). The exhibit, ""Now-Time Venezuela"", is the first in a six-part cycle exploring the revolutionary changes taking place in Venezuela, and the intersection between revolutionary social change and art. The beautifully produced exhibit consists of six short films, each running on a continuous loop, which can be watched in succession on individual floating screens and listened to on high-quality headphones. The accompanying exhibit guides are designed to look like the booklets of laws and decrees that can be seen everywhere in Venezuela. The exhibit thoughtfully combines the quiet, peaceful atmosphere of the museum's clean, white walls and simple benches, with the vibrant color and revolutionary spirit of the films themselves. Film-maker Dario Azzellini and Luis Primo at the BAM exhibit, with ALCASA director Carlos Lanz on the screen behind them Five of the films focus on five different Venezuelan factories being run either as cooperatives, under workers' co-management, or under workers' control. Set against a backdrop of factory towers and running machinery, the workers confidently speak for themselves about the profound social and economic changes they are directly participating in. The sixth and final film takes us into a managers' meeting at the ALCASA aluminum plant, where factory director Carlos Lanz and the rest of the democratically elected management team discuss a new way of running a factory, one that produces for social need, not individual profit. The footage was shot by the film-making team of Dario Azzellini and Oliver Ressler, whose first film ""Venezuela from Below"" has been an invaluable tool in educating people around the world as to the real processes taking place in Venezuela. The 6 films that make up ""Now-Time Venezuela"" will be available in a few weeks' time as a single 81 minute film, which will provide people around the world with an intimate look at the ""nuts and bolts"" of the process of ""co-gestion obrera"" (workers co-management). This important exhibit highlights the vital role art can and must play in the revolutionary process, and shows that ""ordinary"" people can make and enjoy real art, revolutionary art. As the BAM's MATRIX program curator Chris Gilbert explained, the project's main aim is to defend the Bolivarian Revolutionary process, but it also ""contributes to a theory about art and its relation to political activism: along with attempting to reposition art closer to the media's information-bearing capacities and efficacy, it recognizes the need for activist representational strategies that do not merely document but also contribute to their subjects."" It invites the entire Berkeley community and indeed the whole of society to discuss the relationship between art and revolutionary change. We extend our warmest gratitude to Karen Bennett, Chris Gilbert, Dario Azzellini, Oliver Ressler, and everyone else who opened up their hearts, art, minds, and museum to Luis Primo and the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The discussions we had on Venezuela, art, workers' control, and revolution were a refreshing change of pace from the often stuffy, rarefied atmosphere of many modern art museums. People from all walks of life attended the exhibit's dynamic and interactive premiere, including many that had never before set foot in the BAM. Film-makers Oliver Ressler and Dario Azzellini, Luis Primo of the UNT, the Berkeley Art Museum's MATRIX program curator Chris Gilbert, and John Peterson of the US Hands Off Venezuela Campaign outside the BAM This new cycle on Venezuela truly puts the Berkeley Art Museum on the cutting edge, and represents an important contribution to the vital discussion on the interrelationship between art and revolution. Artistically, ""Now-Time Venezuela"" is both innovative and revolutionary, yet it remains down to earth and accessible to all. We enthusiastically invite everyone interested in Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution to pay a visit. You can learn more about the BAM and ""Now-Time Venezuela"" by clicking here .",NA,NA

													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela - www.ushov.org"," Luis Primo's only tour stop away from the West Coast was a visit to Tucson, AZ on the same day Vice President Dick Cheney was in town. In a land where the issue of immigration from Latin America is a question of life and death (hundreds die each year attempting to cross the arid deserts of Arizona), Primo spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of trade unionists, youth, and social activists. The tone for the evening was set by the outstanding Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Jose Saavedra, and singer-activist Ted Warmbrand's moving banjo-backed rendition of ""Who's Side Are You On?"" and a song about 2 young immigrant rights activists from Arizona who face 15 years in prison for the ""crime"" of helping immigrants survive the desert crossing. Jose Saavedra Ted Warmbrand Primo's exposition of the history of the CTV and the emergence of the UNT was met with great interest. He emphasized the need to link up the various struggles emerging in the US: the anti-war movement, the movement for immigrant rights, the labor movement, the movements to close the NED and the School of the Americas, etc. He explained that every little victory we achieve here in the US is a victory for the world revolution. Primo's message was enthusastically applauded and his call for genuine democracy - participatory democracy - as opposed to ""false"" representative democracy, was also appreciated by the audience, which asked a variety of questions after his speech. Thanks to all those who worked to organize this successful event, in particular SOAS Watch, and to all those who showed such generous hospitality during Primo's brief stay in Arizona. ",NA,NA

			Hands Off Venezuela Brighton  launched",2006-04-03T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," About thirty people met at Community Base in Brighton on Wednesday night and decided to set up a local group to campaign in defence of the revolutionary process in Venezuela. After watching the inspirational Irish documentary, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, there was a wide-ranging discussion on what could be done. Suggestions ranged from monitoring and challenging the media, demanding our local MPs distance themselves from Tony Blair’s recent attacks on Venezuela, intervening in local Mayday events, arranging film shows and discussions around the area, including on the university campuses, to investigating the possibilities of twinning community organisations in both countries and organising our own day-school to develop our familiarity and understanding of the exciting developments in Venezuela. People agreed to meet again next week to discuss how to prioritise and organise this work. The meeting came out of an earlier talk on Venezuela given by Espe Espigares of the national HOV campaign to the Brighton Hands Off group, which organises discussions around Iraq and other anti-war issues. Those present at the launch of Brighton HOVe came from a variety of campaign groups, trade unions, community and political organisations and NGOs, as well as just concerned individuals anxious to learn more and support the efforts of the Venezuelan people to develop their own alternatives to the market fundamentalism that has wreaked such havoc on the peoples of Latin America and many other parts of the world. The meeting sold £40 worth of videos and Venezuela ABC pamphlets from the national HOV, and raised a further £55 to pay for the room and begin building up a local fund. It is clear there is a huge appetite for work around Venezuela among important sections of the community here in Brighton. The challenge now is to bring that energy together into a dynamic and useful local campaign. ",NA,NA

			HOV Germany: Public meetings with Che Guevara's daughter, Aleida Guevara",2006-03-28T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV Germany"," Hands off Venezuela in Germany played a decisively role in the preparation and organisation of successful public meetings with Che Guevara´s daughter, Aleida Guevara, last week. The meetings on the situation in Latin America attracted far more people than even the biggest of optimists would have expected as 450 workers, youth and Latin American immigrants attended the Frankfurt meeting on Saturday, 25 March, and 250 were packed into the hall in Wiesbaden two days earlier. Aleida Guevara, who works as a paediatrician in Havana and proudly defends her father’s ideals, had been invited to Germany by the “Linke Liste Wiesbaden”, a local left alliance, and meet fellow doctors and health workers in hospitals as well as anybody interested in the changing scene in Latin America. The comrades of HOV Germany did their utmost to make the two major public meetings an outstanding success. Both in Frankfurt, where the local left alliance (Die Linke.WASG) and HOV were the organisers, and in Wiesbaden, where the left alliance and [‘solid], the socialist youth, were the organisers, Aleida emphatically defended the gains of the Cuban health and education systems on the basis of a planned economy. In spite of the US embargo and major economic difficulties, Cuba had managed to keep infant mortality extremely low and life expectancy on very high “first-world” levels at the same time. The Cubans had something to lose and would not allow the former rulers, capitalism and imperialism back onto the island, conquer the land and establish a “third world” capitalism, she stressed. Aleida Guevara also criticised the hypocrisy of the European Union that deplored the “violation of human rights” in Cuba while accepting most severe violations of human right by the US administration in the Guantánamo military base as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was capitalism that denied 80% of humankind basic human rights such as health and education. Unlike in Cuba, in a potentially very rich country such as Argentina starvation and homelessness were on the order of the day for many children. This was indeed a very particular violation of human rights, which nobody in the US administration and European Union have really bothered about. Aleida also emphasized the fact that in spite of economic problems Cuba would continue to send doctors, technicians and teachers to poor countries and reminded the audience of the continuing commitment by Cuban doctors in the earthquake zones in Kashmir as well as the involvement of some 23,000 Cuban teachers and health specialists in Venezuela. César Osvelio Méndez González, Venezuelan Consul General in Frankfurt, spoke at both public meetings and underlined the special character of the cooperation between Venezuela and Cuba. He described the process of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela and stressed the determination of the Bolivarian government to stand up against imperialist bullying and continue the work to the benefit of the poorer sections of society. Venezuela would remain vigilant and was prepared to fight back against any intervention by the US, he said. Another speaker on the platform in Wiesbaden was Déborah Azcuy, First Secretary at the Cuban embassy in Germany, who indicted the constant attempts by the US administration to harass the Cuban government and turn the clock back. Both meetings were chaired by Hans-Gerd Öfinger who spoke on behalf of “Hands off Venezuela“ in Germany and urged the audience to get involved in the solidarity work and put pressure upon German trade unions to establish official links with the UNT, the new and militant Venezuelan union federation.

													Rob Sewell, National Union of Journalists, London Central branch"," The annual delegate conference of the National Union of Journalists, meeting in Liverpool, once again yesterday pledged “its solidarity with all those in Venezuela who are resisting American imperialism and building a society orientated towards socialism”. The 45,000-strong union, the most important body of journalists in Britain, gave its support to the solidarity work of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and agreed to the “1) building of links with the UNT trade unions, 2) promoting the gains made by the Venezuela workers, 3) publicising the union’s opposition to any interference by the USA in Venezuelan internal affairs”. The motion which came from the Book branch of the union was moved by Sylvia Courtnage and seconded by Steve Jones, both of whom outlined the successes of the Chavez government and the need for the union to maintain its position of solidarity with Venezuela. The annual conference also welcomed the launching of Vive TV and Telesur “in an effort by the Venezuelan people to counteract US sponsored misinformation across Latin America and as a vehicle to extend education, culture, arts and progressive ideas throughout the continent.” This resolution, submitted by the London Central branch, was seconded by journalist Iain Bruce from the BBC. He praised the new media in Venezuela in its efforts to provide an alternative viewpoint to the opposition-dominated media. The resolution went on to instruct the National Executive to build solidarity with and send messages of support to these new broadcasting bodies. Once again, British journalists have sided with the revolution in Venezuela. Hopefully this growing support will become increasingly reflected in the British media. ",NA,NA

			 Venezuelan Trade Unionist Luis Primo in Washington State: Olympia and Seattle",2006-03-28T00:00:00Z,"
															
													U.S. Hands Off Venezuela - www.ushov.org"," Luis Primo, leader of the Venezuelan National Union of Workers (UNT), continued his Hands Off Venezuela West Coast tour with a full day of events in Olympia and Seattle on Monday, March 20. His first event was an informal discussion over lunch with several Olympia trade union activists from the Labor Education and Research Center (LERC) of Evergreen State College. Anne Fischel and Peter Kardas of Evergreen College and the LERC, and Tam Tocher and Joanne McCaughan of AFSCME asked Primo a variety of questions on the current state of the labor movement in Venezuela. Many questions focused on the issue of workers’ co-management, the cooperative movement, and endogenous development. Everyone present was very interested in the Venezuelan workers’ recovery of the oil industry during the 2002 / 2003 bosses’ sabotage. They were also very interested in acquiring more concrete information on the development of the UNT and the process of workers’ co-management. Primo then spoke at the Olympia Labor Temple to roughly 40 Evergreen students and trade unionists. He gave a historical analysis of the CTV, the trade union movement generally, and the formation of the UNT. A series of questions, answers, and discussion followed, and it was clear that those present had a good understanding of the what is happening in Venezuela today. Primo emphasized the need for American workers and youth to build a broad movement in solidarity with Venezuela. But even more importantly, he explained the need to link up all the important struggles that are taking place in the US. He explained that the best solidarity the American people can offer the Venezuelan Revolution is to struggle against imperialism and injustice here at home. Only by making a revolution here in the US will the world be free from tyranny and imperialist oppression. Primo’s brief visit to Olympia was an important opportunity to discuss the Venezuelan revolutionary process in the capital of Washington state. At SEIU Local 6 in Seattle Later that same day, Primo spoke to a group of workers and activists in Seattle, mostly members from SEIU Local 6 (Service Employees International Union). With immigrant rights such an important issue in the US today, they were particularly interested to hear how the Bolivarian government of Venezuela has naturalized some 2 million Colombian nationals through “Mission Identity”, and how the Venezuelan workers have opened their arms to these class brothers and sisters. At the Seattle Labor Temple Primo then addressed roughly 50 workers and activists at the Seattle Labor Temple. He spoke on the history of the CTV, the rise of the UNT, and on the need for American workers to deepen their own struggle for real participatory and direct democracy. At all the day's events, he stressed the need to link up all the various struggles the American people are engaged in so as to continue raising their consciousness and transform society. ",NA,NA

In an event co-organized by the Center for Latin American Studies, the Andean Project, the Venezuelan Working Group of Berkeley, and HOV, Primo spoke to a packed classroom room of around 60 students, faculty, workers, and other members of the Berkeley community. After his introduction, Primo engaged the audience in a broad-ranging discussion. He outlined the history of the CTV and the rise of the UNT, with a focus on the question of workers' co-management. Primo explained the wide variety of economic models that are being developed in Venezuela, from the rapidly expanding cooperative movement, to workers' co-management with the state, to the advanced model of workers' control being developed by the workers of ALCASA. He explained how the UNT is working to develop social-political trade unionism, a new kind of trade unionism that organizes and incorporates broad layers of society, not just full-time workers, including part-time workers, workers in the informal sector, students, housewives, indigenous peoples' movements, and other social movements throughout society. He also explained the beginnings of a new model for social production and development that connects economic centers such as a basic-industry factory with the community and the region around it. His emphasis on the need for democracy and debate within the labor movement and throughout society was also well-received. His message that the best way to build solidarity with Venezuela and Latin America as a whole is to struggle for revolutionary change right here in the ""belly of the beast"" was enthusastically applauded. Thanks to all those that attended and helped organize this excellent event. 3335 Dwinelle Hall at UC Berkeley Was Packed by Students, Faculty, Workers , and Members of the Community ",NA,NA

Primo spoke on the history of the CTV, the Venezuelan trade union struggle in general and the formation of the UNT. The audience was very excited when Primo explained how workers came together and took control of the state oil company PDVSA during the bosses lock out. A strong emphasis during his speech was the need for worker’s participatory democracy not only in Venezuela but also in the United States. After speaking on Venezuela, Primo addressed the events unfolding here in the United States. He stressed the need to broaden the immigrant and anti-war movements and link them with other struggles. A discussion followed, during which the topic of workers' democratic participation was the most popular. Here again, Primo stressed the need to link all struggles to further the consciousness of working people in the US and around the world. Thanks to everyone who made this successful event possible.

			Bolivarian revolution present at the anti-war demonstration in London",2006-03-20T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela"," Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution was on the minds of many at the large anti-war demonstration this weekend in London. Although the police estimate that only 15,000 people participated in the march and the rally at Trafalgar Square, the organizers put the figure at approximately 100,000. Hands off Venezuela supporters had a stall with a large banner. At the stall we sold books, pamphlets, DVDs and distributed leaflets advertising a meeting which was held in a pub near Trafalgar Square after the rally. The stall was very busy and in the end we sold out of all our material. HoV members also distributed thousands of small Venezuelan flags, which could be seen throughout the march and rally. It was clear from the interest in Venezuela that the Bolivarian Revolution has become a well-known issue amongst activists and youth. The HoV stall was very busy and many people who came already knew about the history and the events of the Revolution, such as the coup in 2002, the bosses’ lockout of 2002/2003, as well as Chavez’s referendum victory in 2004. Many were familiar with the issues as well as the various documentaries and books on the subject. The Venezuelan revolution is clearly a growing issue and was raised on the speakers’ platform in Trafalgar Square by London Mayor Ken Livingstone. Many had heard about the Revolution through the comments of arch-reactionary Pat Robertson (who recommended that the US government simply assassinate Chavez) and Tony Blair, who just a few weeks ago, apparently forgetting the military adventure in Iraq that he launched, told Chavez that the Venezuelan government should “abide by the rules of the international community.” These comments have driven people to investigate the issues for themselves. What most people can see is that the Venezuelan Revolution needs to be defended against the imperialists, and also that the achievements of the Revolution in Venezuela, such as the “missions” and the reforms in education, health care, and other social programmes are needed here in the UK and elsewhere. Since coming to office the Blair government has done nothing but attack living standards, working conditions, and made drastic cuts to education, health care, and other social programmes. Venezuela is a shining example of what can and should be done here – an example of what people want to see in their own countries around the world. From the point of view of the imperialists, this is the real danger of the Venezuela Revolution. The HoV meeting after the demonstration was also a great success. Some 100 people turned up to the pub just off Trafalgar Square to hear Jorge Martin speak on the Venezuelan Revolution. Speaking to the crowded room Jorge gave a brief outline of the history of the Bolivarian Revolution (the 1989 Caracazo uprising, the February 1992 military uprising led by Chavez, the 1998 election victory etc.). He explained how the “owners of the banks, industry and the land in an alliance with US imperialism organised an armed insurrection against the Chavez government” in April 2002, and how this was defeated by the direct mass action of the people in the streets. It was also the “oil workers, the organised communities and sections of the national guard that defeated the December 2002 oil sabotage and bosses’ lock out”, he explained, in an example of how “workers can run industry without bosses or managers”. Martin explained the experiences of workers’ control and management that are taking place in Venezuela and how president Chavez has opened the debate about Socialism of the 21st Century. Finally Jorge Martin reminded the audience that the dangers threatening the Venezuelan revolution are very real. In the last few days, he explained “there has been an attempt to use so-called autonomist demands in the oil rich state of Zulia on the border with Colombia,” as a way of creating chaos which would “justify” a military intervention. Also the recently published National Security Strategy Report of the United States says that “in Venezuela, a demagogue awash in oil money is undermining democracy and seeking to destabilize the region”, which Jorge considered to be not only an outright lie, but something more dangerous, a direct threat from Washington against the Bolivarian Revolution. For all these reasons Jorge Martin appealed to all those present to join Hands off Venezuela and become active in the defence of the Revolution. The HoV intervention was a great success. Interest in the Venezuelan Revolution is growing, and the issue has clearly penetrated the consciousness of many activists and youth. We are steadily building the movement in solidarity with the Revolution – by trying to break the news blackout, by spreading information and awareness and in holding meetings and discussing the ideas and the achievements of the Revolution. If you want to get involved and help to actively defend the Bolivarian Revolution, please contact us and join the HoV Campaign! ",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela"," Venezuela Emergency Response Network Formed – April Week of Grassroots Venezuela Solidarity Actions – Appeal for Endorsements ****PLEASE DISTRIBUTE WIDELY**** Emergency Response Network (ERN) On the weekend of March 4-6, 2006, over 400 people gathered at the Venezuela Solidarity Conference in Washington, DC to form a Venezuela Solidarity Network (VSN). One of the decisions taken by acclamation of the delegates present was the formation of a Venezuela Emergency Response Network (ERN). ( http://www.ushov.org/ern_petition.pdf ) Several organizations and individuals are already working to coordinate and develop the ERN. We invite others to join us in this effort in order to build a broad and far-reaching network. The ERN will link up tens and hundreds of thousands of people in the US and around the world in order to respond to provocations against Venezuela both large and small. The first tier of response would be the coordination of email, phone, and related campaigns in response to Venezuela-related legislative initiatives, media disinformation, and inflammatory rhetoric from persons in the public eye. The second tier would involve calls for and the organization of public demonstrations in response to critical provocations and interventions such as coup or assassination attempts, electoral manipulation, economic sabotage, or invasion by either the U.S. or its proxies. For example, if Pat Robertson were to again call for Chavez' assassination, we could coordinate a massive email / fax / phone call / letters-to-the-editor response. If there are more serious provocations, we will have a network and plan in place in order to mobilize on the streets against it. We encourage everyone who opposes US intervention in Venezuela to get in touch with us in order to start building a far-reaching ERN in order to respond to any and all provocations.

			Luis Primo (Venezuelan UNT) Visits Vancouver",2006-03-24T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Joel Bergman, HOV Vancouver"," Venezuelan trade union leader Luis Primo visited Vancouver on the 4 th day of what has been a very busy west coast tour. Luis is the Caracas-Miranda Regional Coordinator of the Venezuelan National Union of Workers (UNT) and is also a member of the National Coordinating Committee for the UNT. Luis first spoke to the Vancouver and District Labour Council at one of their monthly Pizza Educationals. He talked about the history of the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV). Upon its inception in the 1940s, the CTV started as a progressive, class conscious workers' union. However, a process of degradation which began in the 1960s reduced the CTV to a corrupt caricature of its former self . Luis spoke of the difference between participatory democracy and traditional representative democracy, which he deems to be a dictatorship. This issue was especially well received and Luis received a standing ovation from the approximately 50 trade unionists present. Luis was then quickly transported to the second event which was held at the Simon Fraser University’s campus in downtown Vancouver. The event, organized by Hands off Venezuela Vancouver was well attended by 80 local activists and youth. For this event Luis’s speech was much longer. He went into further depth about the history of the CTV and highlighted the formation of the UNT in Venezuela and its role as the new democratic workers’ union. Luis talked about the significance of the global antiwar movement and highlighted its importance in the defense of the Venezuelan revolution. He also talked about factory occupations and the processes of workers’ control and co-management that many factories in Venezuela have implemented. Luis talked about the occupation and running of the oil industry as an example of the will of the Venezuelan people to run society themselves. This was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. The speech was followed by a debate/question period in which various questions about the Bolivarian revolutionary process were answered by Luis. The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign was well received at both events. Many workers took the information brochures and there was much talk about union endorsement. Very heartfelt thanks go out to the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, the Vancouver and District Labour Council, the Industrial Workers of the World Vancouver, the Internationalist Bolivarian Circle of Vancouver (Bob Everton) and many others who made these events possible.

			500 Gather in Washington, DC to form National Venezuela Solidarity Network",2006-03-09T00:00:00Z,"
															
													John Peterson","On the weekend of March 4-6, some 500 people from across the US, Canada, Latin America, and Europe gathered in Washington DC for a series of workshops, plenary sessions, cultural events, and demonstrations as part of the Venezuela Solidarity Conference (VSC). Despite visa problems for a number of Venezuelans who were to present at some of the workshops and plenaries, the conference, held on the George Washington University campus was a resounding success. Some 40 workshops were presented on a wide range of topics topics such as Venezuelan history, the health care missions, the role of women in the revolutionary process, organizing solidarity in the U.S. and Canadian labor movements, the role of Afro-Venezuelans, the Venezuela Constitution, building an Emergency Response Network and implementing a calendar of Venezuela solidarity actions, the Citgo ""Buycott"" campaign, and the case of Luis Posada Carriles among many others. Click here for the full list of workshops offered (although some were unfortunately cancelled at the last minute). In addition to the workshops there were a number of plenary sessions which discussed the U.S. Agenda for Latin America, Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution, and the forming of the National Venezuela Solidarity Network. The discussions ranged from the economics of ALBA and the Citgo heating oil program, to the role Plan Colombia and the importance of defending the Cuban Revolution as well. Some speakers presented a solid grass roots and working class perspective, while other had a more liberal focus, with some participants limiting their efforts to seeking votes for the Democratic Party. On Saturday evening there was an well-attended public event with speakers, poetry, and music at All Souls Church. Dozens of organizations worked closely and harmoniously for several months to organize this event, showing what can be done when people from the most varied backgrounds come together around an issue as important as defending the Venezuelan revolutionary process. Many of these organizations were represented at the conference with tables of books, pamphlets, leaflets, films, T-Shirts, stickers, and other Venezuela and Latin America solidarity-related items. Miami's Bolivarian Youth Some organizations, like the Bolivarian Youth of Miami are an excellent example of grass roots, labor-oriented organizations in solidarity with the revolution. There were also many trade unionists present, working to bring greater working class awareness of events in Venezuela. The US / Canada Hands Off Venezuela table was visited by hundreds of people, and was always buzzing with discussions on the international HOV campaign and the situation in Venezuela. Many conference attendees stopping to have their picture taken with the HOV banner. Click here to see a list of organizations that co-sponsored the event. On Monday, March 6, dozens of conference attendees visited their legislative representatives in a morning of lobbying. Later that same day, at 12:00 noon, some 70-80 people gathered in front of the offices of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in the largest-ever demonstration against this thoroughly anti-democratic institution. Chanting ""Hands Off Venezuela! Hands Off Haiti!"" and carrying posters and banners calling for the shutting down of the NED and opposition to military action against Iran and other countries, the demo was a big success. Media from the Associated Press, ViveTV, and Radio Nacional de Venezuela were present. The small crowd then marched to the headquarters of the AFL-CIO, located just 4 blocks away, to protest against the funding the trade union federation's ""Solidarity Center"" receives from the NED. [The NED also funds the The International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, and the Center for International Private Enterprise (Chambers of Commerce)] Click here for the flyer used to promote this event. All in all the conference was an exhilirating and energetic event, with the hundreds of delegates leaving with a sense of having participated in the beginning of what we hope will become a truly broad network that will successfully defend Venezuela's revolutionary process against foreign intervention. It was a terrific opportunity to meet hundreds of other grassroots solidarity activists from around the world, to learn from their experience, and to share ideas about taking the Venezuela and Latin America solidarity movement to the next level. Plenary Session of the VSC What Next? Building the Venezuela Emergency Response Network So where do we go from here? Hands Off Venezuela supports fully the actions committee proposal to build a Venezuela Emergency Response Network (ERN), which was aproved by acclamation by the final plenary session of the conference. Several organizations and individuals are working to coordinate and develop the ERN. The ERN will link up tens and hundreds of thousands of people around the world in order to respond to provocations against Venezuela both large and small. The first tier would be the coordination of email, phone, and related campaigns in response to Venezuela-related legislative initiatives, media disinformation, and inflammatory rhetoric from persons in the public eye. The second tier would involve calls for and the organization of public demonstrations in response to critical provocations and interventions such as coup or assassination attempts, electoral manipulation, economic sabotage, or invasion by either the U.S. or its proxies.

If there are more serious provocations, we will have a network and plan in place in order to mobilize on the streets against it. We encourage all our readers and supporters to learn more about the ERN and to get in touch with us in order to start building a far-reaching ERN in order to respond on a massive scale to any and all provocations against Venezuela.

Despite differences among some of the delegates as to how the VSN should be organized and implemented, we are hopeful that it will develop into a truly broad solidarity movement. In our opinion, the most positive aspect is the commitment by a number of young and working class activists to build and promote the ERN and Calendar of Actions at the grassroots level. Hands Off Venezuela is committed to energetically developing this work.

													Hands Off Venezuela","A very successful meeting took place in Brighton on Thursday March 2. The meeting was organised by “Hands off”, which is a group based in Brighton that aims to support activists. It also sees its role as educating themselves in the issues which confront those struggling for peace and justice. (See http://www.watchingthewarmakers.org.uk/ for more information.) They have regular discussions and this month’s topic was the turn of the Venezuelan Revolution, and they invited a Hands Off Venezuela speaker to introduce the discussion. Despite being told that maybe only a few would turn up, around 70 people turned up and the meeting was excellent, including a very lively debate. There was a lot of interest in the subject, which again shows the enthusiasm that can be generated for the Venezuelan Revolution and the fact that something positive is happening in the world. At the end of the meeting signatures where collected from people who wanted to help with the campaign. Around 30 people queued to leave their contact details. As a follow-up, an HOV meeting is being organised for the end of March. If you are in the Brighton area and you would like to help or receive information about HOV’s activities in Brighton, please send us an email to This email address is being protected from spambots.

			Minneapolis: Successful Venezuela Film Premiere",2006-02-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","On Friday, February 17, over 30 people braved the -10 below zero weather to attend the Minneapolis Premiere of ""The Old Man and Jesus: Prophets of Rebellion"". The latest film by the Calle y Media collective follows the lives of two homeless people in Caracas during the bosses' sabotage of the oil industry in late 2002. This inspiring documentary shows just how deep the revolutionary consciousness of the Venezuelan masses flows. The passion and revolutionary fervor of the most downtrodden members of society should give us all hope that another world is indeed possible. The film was well-received (with an ovation), and was followed by a wide-ranging discussion facilitated by supporters of Hands Off Venezuela. Interest in Venezuela is growing rapidly in Minneapolis and around the country, and with U.S. intervention sure to increase during the upcoming Venezuelan Presidential elections, it is important that we organize energetically to prevent it. There are many lessons we in the U.S. can learn from the Venezuelan revolutionary process, and this is precisely why the U.S. government has its sights on Chavez and the Bolivarian masses. Several people signed up to learn more about HOV and local solidarity activities, and we raised some money towards building the campaign. We have several events planned for the coming months, including a report back on the Venezuela Solidarity Conferences taking place in New York and Washington, DC. Stay tuned for details. We thank everyone for coming out on that brutally cold night (the coldest in 2 years!), and thanks to Mapps Coffee and Tea for having us; we hope to show more films at Mapps in the near future. We encourage you to get involved with building the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign; there is a lot of work to be done! We invite you to attend our next event: Minneapolis Film Showing: ""Venezuela Bolivariana"" ***PLEASE DISTRIBUTE WIDELY*** WHAT: An Introduction to the Venezuelan Revolution: A Presentation and Discussion on the film ""Venezuela Bolivariana"" WHERE: Waite House (2529 13th Ave. S. in Minneapolis) WHEN: Friday, February 24th at 6:00 pm This 76-minute documentary by Venezuelan film maker Marcelo Andrade examines the Venezuelan Revolution as connected to the worldwide movement against capitalist globalization. The main theme is how the Bolivarian Revolution, thanks to its incredible grassroots and networking power, transcends the national frontiers of Venezuela and contributes with concrete alternatives in the fight against neoliberal capitalism. Covering the period from the 1989 ""Caracazo"" to the April 2002 coup against Chavez and beyond, this is a must-see film and an excellent introduction to what is happening today in Venezuela. A discussion on the film and recent events in Venezuela will follow. We will also be reporting on the upcoming Venezuela Solidarity Conference to be held in Washington, DC on March 4-6.

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Friday, February 24, over 20 people gathered at the Waite House community center in South Minneapolis for a viewing and discussion of ""Venezuela Bolivariana"", a film by Marcelo Andrade of the ""Calle y Media"" collective. Minneapolis area residents from all walks of life participated in a warm and open discussion on Venezuela before and after the film. There was much interest in the history and current situation in Venezuela, as well as in the activities of Hands Off Venezuela (HOV). The Twin Cities' alternative paper ""Pulse"" featured an article on Venezuela and the HOV Campaign this week, several people in attendance found out about the event through that article, which can be viewed here: http://pulsetc.com/article.php?sid=2327 . This was the first in what will be an ongoing series of Venezuela film presentations at the Waite House, in an effort to reach out to educate and inform wider layers of the community as to what is truly happening in Venezuela. We thank the Waite House for having us, for their gracious hospitality, and for the refreshments! We have a number of upcoming events planned, including a week of events and activities in mid April. We hope to bring a young Venezuelan community activist up for this week of activities, as there is much we can learn from what is happening at the grass roots level in Venezuela. We will also be reporting on Venezuela Solidarity Conferences being held in NY and Washington, DC. Stay tuned for details.

													Martin Oscarsson, Coordinator for Hands off Venezuela in Sweden","At the beginning of February the Swedish site of Hands off Venezuela, www.handsoffvenezuela.se , was launched. The site will be updated at least twice a month and has got already 60 subscribers to its newsletter. In a small country like Sweden a website can get a wide audience quickly. It will also serve to spread the campaign to other areas in the country. The aim is to answer the silence and the lies about Venezuela in the Swedish media, and to raise solidarity for the Venezuelan revolution within the labour movement and amongst the youth. The site also contains articles about other countries in Latin America. It is therefore a major step forward for the campaign in Sweden. With the help of the site we will launch a trade union petition for the UNT, organise a Venezuela block in the May Day demonstration in Gothenburg, and try to get a speaker at the Left Party (former CP) meeting on May Day. The campaign is so far based in Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden and the centre of the Volvo and SAAB car plants.",NA,NA

U.S. Hands Off Venezuela is launching a fundraising appeal to cover the expenses we will incur. Dear Friend: The Hands Off Venezuela campaign (HOV) is an organization of groups and individuals who support the right of the people of Venezuela to self-determination and oppose any intervention by the United States against the democratically elected government of Venezuela. It looks like the U.S. government is on a collision course with Hugo Chavez, arguably the most popular president in Latin America. However, we cannot stop U.S. intervention by words alone, but only by the action of the people of the United States, and they cannot take action without knowledge. That is why we are calling on all freedom-loving people in the U.S. to help us bring the truth about Venezuela to this country by bringing here one of its most important trade union leaders, Luis Primo. Luis Primo, a member of the Venezuelan National Union of Workers (UNT) will be in the U.S. to speak between March 18 and 25. He will speaking at the antiwar rally in San Francisco on March 18. On Saturday, March 25 he will be speaking at a public meeting at the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Local 34 Hall, which is on the Embarcadero, next to the SBC Ballpark. Currently, Primo is a Regional Coordinator for the UNT (Caracas-Miranda). He is also responsible for Trade Union/Political Education for the UNT on the national level. His other UNT assignment is working with the Ministry of Labor on the Committee on the Recovered Factories. He is the former president of the Caracas metro workers union. Primo will also be running for the National Leadership of the UNT at its upcoming congress this spring. Your help is needed now! In order to bring Luis Primo here, we will have to pay for his travel expenses and living expenses while he is here, so we are in need of your financial help. Please help us stop the U.S. intervention in the internal affairs of Venezuela. Send us your donation of $100, $15, $10, or whatever you can. Checks should be made payable to Hands Off Venezuela.

			Hands Off Venezuela and Venezuela Solidarity Campaign protest against Blair’s attacks",2006-02-16T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","Hands off Venezuela (HOV) and Venezuela Solidarity Campaign (VSC) supporters gathered outside the Venezuelan consulate yesterday, February 15 th , to express solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution and to oppose the attacks made on Venezuela by Prime Minister Tony Blair last week in the House of Commons. The Venezuela solidarity movement found Blair’s remarks about how Chavez should “abide by the rules of the international community” absolutely ridiculous. The British Prime Minister telling the leader of any country that they should abide by the rules of the international community is laughable, especially when, as Chavez himself explained, Blair is the one who flouted international law the most when he sided with Bush to invade Iraq. Blair’s comments come at a time when Washington is intensifying pressure against Chavez. There is a lot of talk in Washington about Chavez being a ""dictator"". The truth of the matter is that Venezuela has one of the most democratic constitutions in the world in which article 72 gives the Venezuelan people the right to recall any MP, councillor, civil servant – anybody elected by the people, including the president himself – at the half-way through their term. The opposition in Venezuela tried to use this clause in the Constitution as a means to overthrow Chavez. However, they were unable to do so as Chavez’s support is enormous. 90% of the eligible population voted in this recall referendum. This level of participation shows that in Venezuela people do not feel that “all politicians are the same”. The people knew what was at stake and they went out to exercise their rights and vote, sometimes waiting in queues at polling station for 10 hours. Chavez received around 63% of the votes in the recall referendum while the opposition received 36%. This was not by any means the only chance that the Venezuelan people have had to express through electoral means what they think. In the last 7 years Chavez and his policies have been ratified in 11 different electoral processes. Even more important than that is the fact that the Venezuelan Revolution has been tremendously effective in involving people in the everyday aspects of political life. Now Tony Blair comes along to “show Venezuelans what democracy is all about”. We do not believe that Chavez can learn anything about democracy from Blair. On the other hand we think that Blair could learn a lot about “education, education, education” from Chavez. Since he was elected President in 1998 illiteracy has been completely eradicated from the country. One million children have been brought into the education system, 657 new schools have been created, eight new universities have been established and 36,000 additional teachers have been hired – and these are just some of the advances made in the field of education, not to mention the advances in healthcare and other social programmes! The ranks of the British labour and trade union movement look on the Chavez government with great sympathy. They instinctively understand what is at stake. This explains why so many trade unions and trade unionists have given their support to our solidarity work. They compare the genuine reforms in education, healthcare, social assistance for the poor, and the nationalisation of several companies, which have been placed under workers’ control, and they compare this to what we have in Britain, i.e. cuts in education, healthcare, and the privatisation of almost everything that could be privatised. They know which side they are on. At the Consulate the Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK, Alfredo Toro Hardy, welcomed representatives from Hands Off Venezuela and the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign and thanked both campaigns for their support. Andy Goodall, on behalf of VSC read a letter addressed to the Ambassador and Espe Espigares, on behalf of HOV read a letter addressed to Tony Blair protesting against his declarations. This letter has already been signed by Jeremy Dear (General Secretary, NUJ), John McDonell MP, Jeremy Corbyn MP and Tony Benn amongst others. We urge all supporters to sign this appeal .

													Hands Off Venezuela","Statement by Leigh Saavedra, founder of Texas HOV: One of the many disturbing things about our having lost our mainstream media is watching what they are doing to Hugo Chavez, democratically elected president of Venezuela (with no questionable paperless trails, etc. as in our own election). A small group of us is forming a Texas HOV (""Hands Off Venezuela"") support group. Our sole purpose will be to oppose U.S. intervention in Venezuela's hegemony, an intervention that grows parallel with oil needs, Venezuela having the fifth largest oil reservesin the world. Our group will do this by meeting periodically to see films -- many are coming out of the things happening in South America -- and educate first ourselves and then others. Most of you will probably agree that had the majority of our people known the true facts about Iraq, they would never have stood behind an invasion. With Iran now in the crosshairs, it's more important than ever that we stop what most of us can see only as the PNAC's intended imperialistic wars. It is vital that WE learn the facts, of course, but also that we make sure the disinformation wars are not influencing our families and friends. Thus, it is not at ALL too early to learn about Venezuela. Contrary to what Donald Rumsfeld and his boss would like us to fear (fear being their main method of controlling us), Venezuela is NO THREAT to the U.S. I can almost personally promise you that hordes of Venezuelans are not going to head across the Gulf to take over Florida. The idea of seeing Chavez and his people as dangerous to us is about as idiotic as what they tried to make us fear earlier -- that Iraq was going to invade the U.S. Further, it is NOT unAmerican to support Venezuelan and Bolivian sovereignty, to feel happiness at their slow successes in alleviating the great poverty that has resulted from doing things in a way that put all their wealth into the hands of a few. The people of South America do NOT want to continue to live that way, and such desire is NO THREAT to the United States, beyond the possibility that some of us may say, ""Why can't WE have national health coverage?""

We urge all our readers to add their signatures. Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Tony Blair 10 Downing Street, London Dear Prime Minister, We the undersigned were very concerned and alarmed by the remarks you made in the House of Commons on Wednesday 8th February concerning Venezuela. The criticisms you leveled at the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and the need for him to mend his ways and ""abide by the rules of the international community"" were very wide of the mark. Recently, as you are no doubt aware, there has been an avalanche of attacks on the Venezuelan government emanating from the White House. The US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has even gone so far as to compare Chavez to Adolf Hitler. Similar noises were made before the invasion of Iraq and are nothing more than preparation for an unprovoked attack against Venezuela, including on the life of its president. We feel that your intervention last Wednesday, coupled with your criticism of Venezuela’s friendship with Cuba, only add to this Cold War rhetoric and escalation of hostilities against Venezuela. Hugo Chavez and his government have handsomely won no fewer than nine democratic elections, far more than the ""friends"" of the United States such as Saudi Arabia, or the regimes that were previously propped up by the United States throughout Latin America. As you are no doubt aware Prime Minister, the Chavez government has enormous public support arising from the progressive policies introduced since 1998 to benefit the most downtrodden sections of society. President Chavez has managed to eradicate illiteracy with the help of Cuba, has brought one million children into the education system, created 657 new schools, established eight new universities and hired 36,000 additional teachers. For someone who prides himself on education, one would have thought you would have whole-heartedly welcomed such progressive steps. The Chavez government has tried to eliminate the class-ridden latafundia by distributing 2.2m. hectares (5.5m. acres) to 116,000 landless families, and have been organised into co-operatives. Furthermore, the new Bolivarian constitution guarantees the public ownership of Venezuelan oil and the distribution of this wealth to all its citizens, the many and not the few. Other reforms have been introduced providing housing and cheap food to the poorest, mostly indigenous people. On the international front, President Chavez swiftly offered material assistance to the victims of hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and has also provided cheap fuel oil to the poorest families of the United States to keep them from freezing this winter. We could go on. We strongly feel, and hope that you would agree Prime Minister, that it is our responsibility to bring out the facts concerning Venezuela and to give support to genuinely progressive measures in the interests of the majority of the people. Yours sincerely, {FacileForms:ProtestLetterBlair}",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Friday, February 3rd, the Twin Cities Hands Off Venezuela Campaign presented Calle y Media 's film ""Venezuela Bolivariana"" at the Resource Center of the Americas (www.americas.org). As part of the RCTA's Friday movie night, John Peterson, National Secretary of the U.S. Hands Off Venezuela Campaign introduced the film and led a discussion afterwards. The film, which covers a broad period of Venezuelan history, focusing on the years since the “Caracazo” of 1989, was very well received and sparked a lively discussion. A wide range of topics relating to Venezuelan history and current events were raised and explored by the participants. Peterson explained that Bolivar's dream of unifying Latin America is once again on the agenda, and that this has serious implications for the whole of Latin America and the world. It is the example of the Bolivarian masses that most worries the Bush administration: revolutions do not respect borders. The question of Venezuelan-Colombian relations was discussed in some detail, with an experienced Colombian human rights activist explaining the situation in Colombia, and making a moving appeal to the audience to defend the Venezuelan Revolution and the whole of Latin American from U.S. Intervention through Plan Colombia: the choice before us is ""socialism or death"". The importance of defending immigrant rights here in the U.S. was also discussed. Peterson also reported on the upcoming National Venezuela Solidarity Conference to be held March 4-6 in Washington, DC. Funds are being raised to send a delegation from the Twin Cities, with a report back to be held after the conference. The importance of the Venezuelan Revolutionary process was clear to everyone present, and the need to defend it against foreign intervention was enthusiastically supported. The latest ominous pronouncements by Rumsfeld and Negroponte underline the importance of organizing the campaign on an ever-broader basis. Everyone present agreed that the only way to defend the Venezuelan Revolutionary Process is to organize to effect real change here at home. After the meeting, discussions continued around the HOV table; over a dozen people signed up for more information, and donations were made to build the Twin Cities delegation to the VSC in Washington, DC. All in all, it was a successful event; we thank the Resource Center of the Americas for having us. A 3-day Twin Cities premiere of the new “Calle y Media” film, “The Old Man and Jesus: Prophets of Rebellion” is planned for February 16, 17, and 18. Locations and times to be announced next week.

													Pas touche au Venezuela","The public meeting organised in Paris on January 30 th by the Marxist journal La Riposte and the campaign Pas touche au Venezuela! attracted more than 110 people. The meeting took place in the headquarters of the Parisian Federation of the French Communist Party. The main speaker was Alan Woods, the editor of the website of the International Marxist Tendency, In Defence of Marxism . Alan gave an outline of the impasse of world capitalism, emphasising the reactionary role of US imperialism, which is attempting to bully the peoples of the Middle East and of Latin America into submission. But this policy has its limits, Alan pointed out, as shown by the present situation in Iraq and in Latin America. Alan then went on to explain the revolutionary process underway in Venezuela, and also in Bolivia. He emphasised the very real danger, however, in the event that the revolution is not carried forward to a decisive conclusion, that this great historic opportunity to put an end to capitalism could be lost. Maria Antonieta Borjas, representing the Venezuelan Embassy in Paris, warmly thanked Alan Woods, La Riposte and Pas touche au Venezuela! for their work in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. “You will always be welcome in Venezuela” , she told Alan, “we consider you as a Venezuelan citizen!” Greg Oxley, chairing the meeting, underlined the support given to the campaign in France by Maria Antonieta and the Embassy staff. Many of the people in attendance were members or supporters of the Communist Party. The discussion and questions to the speaker showed the enthusiasm of workers and youth in France for the revolutionary movement in Venezuela. One of the most memorable moments of the evening was at the beginning of the meeting, when the chairman announced the presence of Esteban Volkov, the grandson of Leon Trotsky. Esteban was warmly applauded by the meeting. This is a very significant illustration of the increasing acceptance, within the ranks of the Communist Party — in spite of decades of Stalinist lies and slander — of Leon Trotsky as an outstanding representative of Marxism and as the authentic leader, together with Lenin, of the Russian revolution of 1917. The success of this meeting follows on from many other successes of the solidarity campaign promoted by La Riposte in France. Many other initiatives are planned by Pas Touche au Venezuela in the coming weeks and months. February 7, 2006",NA,NA

													John Peterson, US HOV Campaign","On Friday, January 27, around 80 people attended a Venezuela solidarity event at the University of Minnesota's Blegen Hall, sponsored by the Minnesota Venezuela Committee and the U of M. Jesus ""Chucho"" Garcia, an Afro-Venezuelan activist and author, discussed CITGO's discounted fuel program and its impact on poor communities in the United States. He began by outlining the background to the current political situation in Venezuela, raised the question of South American integration, and highlighted the fact that in the U.S. there is extreme poverty as well. In his words, ""the North also has a South"". With the record profits and vast wealth of the U.S. and its oil corporations, it is ironic that a country which is under constant attack by the U.S. government and media is the one country that has donated millions of dollars of fuel to help poor Americans. He cited the examples of Queens, Boston, Vermont, Maine, The Bronx, and now Philadelphia, as recipients of this much-needed relief from high fuel prices. Some 40,000 poor families have benefited from this program, including Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, and poor White Americans. This is a very concrete aid project which is still in its early stages. ""Chucho"" posed the question: is this just demagogy and messing with Bush, or is it genuine international solidarity? According to ""Chucho"", international solidarity is part of the Constitutional mandate of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The introduction was followed by a lively series of questions and responses. ""Chucho"" finished by explaining that there is an awakening across Latin America: this awakening must take place in the ""belly of the beast"" as well. This is our task. * The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign will be presenting the film ""Venezuela Bolivariana"" this Friday, February 3rd at the Resource Center of the Americas.

The consul was attending the event to receive an award being given by the CECP to the government of Venezuela for aid in the form of heating oil donated to thousands low income Americans in Rhode Island and across the east coast of the U.S. Venezuela has donated more than $200 million in oil to aid U.S. workers and poor as heating costs have doubled in the past two years. Many of the attendees of the event took a keen interest in the HOV table. A few had recently returned from visiting the country and were eager to work with HOV in speaking publicly on the positive changes happing now in Venezuela. One woman whose husband was still visiting the Bolivarian Republic said, “What is happening there is something we should all pay attention to.” More than a dozen people signed up to get directly involved in further HOV work, and a decent amount of money was raised for the U.S. HOV campaign. The event happened only days after Donald Rumsfeld made his absurd comparison of the popular, democratically-elected Hugo Chavez and Adolph Hitler. No one at the event seemed to even remotely hold the odious position of the current U.S. leadership, led by the neo-conservative clique of Bush and Co. who have time and time again made it clear as to their position on revolutionary Venezuela. This is summed up in the smug arrogance expressed by former CIA director George Tenet in the film “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised”: “Obviously Venezuela is important because it's the third largest supplier of petroleum, now I would say Mr. Chavez, and the State Department may say this, probably doesn't have the interests of the United States at heart.” Of course it all depends on whose interests in the U.S. you are speaking of: certainly not the multi-national corporations, banks, or the U.S. State Department. But beyond the wealthy and elite are the millions of working class and poor Americans who have the same basic class interests of their brothers and sisters in Venezuela. Had it not been for the massive movement of the workers in Venezuela in responding to the attacks of the oligarchy in each turn, and especially in response to the 2002 bosses' lock out of the state oil company PDVSA, then Chavez would certainly not have been enabled to earmark oil for such programs as the one now benefiting U.S. workers, youth and poor right now. If the workers had not acted to defend their class interests, the shutting down of PDVSA could have been used to destabilize the country, paving the way for a second coup attempt: most likely followed by the privatization of PDVSA. Just as our class brothers and sisters have done in Venezuela, so must we in the U.S. fight for our interests here at home. We can count on the people of Venezuela to support us in this struggle. This is precisely what Hands Off Venezuela is all about: internationalist solidarity of the workers and oppressed of the world. No to U.S. intervention in Venezuela! Help build the HOV campaign, for the international solidarity of the working class!",NA,NA

													Heiko Khoo","Some 60 people attended a film screening of ""The revolution will not be televised,"" of whom around 30 remained to debate. A full, comprehensive and interesting discussion on various issues was held with many people intervening. The first wished to know how the Church in Venezuela has reacted to the revolution. It was pointed out that the leadership of the Catholic Church is hostile to the revolution and Chavez, but that Chavez considers himself a Christian and often uses Christian iconography. For decades the Church in Latin America has been split between progressive and reactionary forces. A few expressed concern about the ""cult of personality"" surrounding Chavez, but could not concretise this feeling of unease; it was pointed out that Rosa Luxemburg is still celebrated on the German left nearly 100 years after her murder. The speaker responded by outlining how Chavez relates to the masses, both feeding off each other, Chavez seems to gather strength from the masses, and senses their moods and impatience for more rapid change. A recent visitor to Venezuela pointed out that there is a very significant and noticeable participation of the masses in the revolutionary processes and organisations, that Latin America has very stark class contradictions, which shape the attitude of the masses. He felt that the main criticisms inside the pro-revolutionary camp in Venezuela are that the process is advancing too slowly. An older man spoke to point out that in 1953 Mossadeq in Iran was overthrown by CIA action, that Chile was the same, that imperialism has no respect for democratic processes. The speakers explained that the contradictions of the world are obvious simply by juxtaposing the events of today. In Davos the world’s rich and powerful are gathered the better to plunder the world, in Caracas activists from all over the world are gathered to say, not ""another world is possible,"" but ""another world is necessary."" A woman asked what we could concretely do to support the revolution. It was pointed out that the Venezuelan revolution has passed from being bourgeois democratic to socialist, and that the main problem we confront is ignorance about the revolution, its achievements, it’s enemies and objectives which are nothing less than Latin American and World Revolution. We have to fight to ensure that everyone knows about the revolution, that the Venezuelan revolution is made the primary question for the left everywhere. We must win the Trade Unions in Germany, the Left Party, even the Greens and Social Democrats. Our main work now is to inform the students and youth to support the Revolution. This woman later approached the information stall at the end of the meeting and identified herself as a former student of Bertolt Brecht, Käthe Reichel. She immediately donated 50 Euros to the campaign and is due to fly to Venezuela with a delegation of the Trade Union IGMetal in February. ""Marxism is coming back"" she said with an air of certainty. She asked what works of Brecht are available in Venezuela and explained she has sent Chavez a framed poem by Brecht. A Colombian PHD student who participated in the formation of the student movement at the Humboldt University at the time of the East German revolution, promised to assist us in our work. Some 20 people asked to come to future meetings and several expressed the desire to participate actively in Hands Off Venezuela. Berlin Hands Off Venezuela are planning a series of events in the Universities and with the left youth organisation Solid, and other left groups, to place Hands off Venezuela on the map in Berlin and Eastern Germany. www.haendewegvonvenezuela.org",NA,NA

			WSF Caracas:  First Meeting of Hands Off Venezuela a Resounding Success",2006-01-27T00:00:00Z,"
															
													our correspondent in Caracas","In central Caracas, more than 300 people packed into the Great Hall of the Caracas Hilton to hear about the international defence of the Venezuelan Revolution. The meeting, organized by the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, brought together representatives from a whole host of countries eager to listen and to debate the burning issue of international solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. The first speaker to address the gathering was Rob Sewell of the British of Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Rob, who is part of an HOV delegation to the World Social Forum, outlined the context in which the Venezuelan Revolution was taking place. “Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been an international ideological campaign by the representatives of imperialism to discredit socialism, revolution, or any idea of challenging capitalism. The struggles unfolding in Latin America, and especially those in Venezuela, have falsified this propaganda…. Today, the leader of the Revolution, Hugo Chavez, is raising the banner of socialism, not only for Venezuela, not for Latin America, but the whole world”, stated Rob. The speaker went on to explain that neither the oligarchy nor the imperialists would ever be reconciled to the Venezuelan Revolution. This was particularly so with American imperialism, which was attempting to dominate the globe. The Venezuelan Revolution was an inspiration to the downtrodden masses of Latin America and the world, which was the reason behind the attempts of imperialism to crush the Revolution. The question of international solidarity with Venezuela was vital. That was the reason why the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign was launched in 2002 after the failed coup to remove President Chavez. The campaign has now spread to over 30 countries. Rob explained that over the last three years the campaign had been successfully taken to the British trade union and Labour movement. Resolutions defending the Venezuelan Revolution had been taken to trade union branches which and then submitted to national conferences of the unions. He quoted the example of Amicus, which has 1.3 million members, when the HOV sponsored resolution to the union’s national conference got the support of 97% of the delegates. The same was true of other trade unions, resulting in a resolution passed unanimously at the national Trades Union Congress, which has an affiliated membership of some seven million members. Rob ended his contribution with an appeal to build the international solidarity campaign. “The Venezuelan cause is our cause. Victory to the Bolivarian Revolution! Victory to socialism!” The next speaker was Charley Allen also from Hands Off Venezuela. He spoke about the importance of organizing the campaign and provided the example of the work in Britain. “Following the coup and lockout, a key struggle was over the recall referendum in August 2004”, stated Charley. “Its affects in London were tremendous. We organized a weeklong campaign during the referendum culminating in a demonstration outside the US embassy. Other campaigns came to join in and build solidarity, such as Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba and Argentina. It was an outstanding moment and showed how events in Venezuela can help build the solidarity movement in other countries.” Charley then went on to explain how the use of films and music had been used to build support and could be methods used elsewhere to build up solidarity work. “We urge you, when you return home”, stated Charley, “to establish campaigns like Hands Off Venezuela or similar organizations to help build the international solidarity work. With our joint efforts, we can make a difference.” The other speakers on the platform included Andy Higginbottom from the Colombia Solidarity Campaign, who spoke about the situation in Colombia and the urgent need to challenge the multinationals. Andy explained in particular the success of the campaign to boycott Coca Cola. Andy was followed by a Colombian trade unionist who spoke about the murder of his fellow trade unionists by the paramilitaries. He called for the establishment of international tribunals on different continents which would lay charges against different multinational corporations. He went on to urge solidarity with Venezuela and the struggles of workers throughout Latin America. Jessica Crocker from the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign spoke about the development of their campaign which was set up in October 2003. The catalyst for the campaign was the revolutionary movement in Bolivia for the nationalization of hydro-carbons. She was followed by Dan Lewenstein from the Indo-american refugee and migrant organization who had just arrived from La Paz, after attending the Presidential inauguration of Evo Morales. He graphically described the tremendous mood in Bolivia with the election of Morales together with the hopes of the masses for the future. The election in Bolivia clearly opens up a new radical front within the continent of Latin America. After a lively discussion, many delegates filled in the address sheet for further information and a number of people approached the organizers at the end to find out how they could best help organize the campaign. The meeting was a great success and a tremendous beginning for HOV at the World Social Forum.",NA,NA

The film documented the efforts by the oil workers and the surrounding community to stop the sabotage of the oil production in late 2002, when the bosses opposed to Chavez were trying to destabilize the government by bringing oil production to a halt. Fortunately, these worker-community efforts were successful, and before long production was resumed. The film conveyed a clear sense of the rising awareness of their own power that ordinary people in Venezuela are experiencing. Christina Vasquez Gutierrez, who just returned from spending several weeks in Venezuela, gave a moving, but balanced account of her experiences there and strongly encouraged members of the audience to join HOV in order to support the revolutionary movement in Venezuela. The power of her remarks was evidenced by the lively discussion that followed. At the end of the evening, many members of the audience expressed their gratitude for the event.

													Hands Off Venezuela","We received two more reports from the World Social Forum in Caracas. Today the International Hands Off Venezuela campaign held its open meeting. A room filled with over 100 people listened to speakers from the campaign including UK organizer Rob Sewell and Canadian organizer Mike Palecek who detailed their work within their respective trade union movements. Sewell talked about the campaign’s resolution proposed to the national Trade Union Congress, which represents over 9 million workers, during that congress before the vote on the HOV resolution the chair told the congress ""what we need in Britain is more Bolivarianism!"". That vote passed in the TUC unanimously. Sewell also spoke of the need to carry forward and spread the revolution to all of Latin America and the world and of the great example Venezuela is serving as by bringing socialism back into the forefront of political discussion. Sewell´s speech received several ovations from the crowd and the HOV activists there gained a great deal of new contacts from all over the world. Outside the HOV event the Venezuelan Revolutionary Marxist Current had a bookstall selling their material, which got a tremendous response from the forum participants. At several points there was a line up simply to see what was on sale at the table. Venezuelan locals in particular seem to be striving for knowledge about socialism and Marxist theory, and there is no shortage of discussions on the subject around the forum. The trade union forum is also taking place as part of the WSF. Today delegates from Venezuela and several other Latin American countries challenged their northern counter-parts to work towards genuine socialism, emphasizing the need to look back at history and see that capitalism provides only band-aid solutions. Said one Caribbean unionist, “A labour movement without a historical perspective, is like a boat without a rudder.” Julian Benson Hands Off Venezuela Ontario (Canada) Revolutionary Greetings from Venezuela, Last night was the opening ceremony of the World Social Forum. A large parade group gathered at the south gate of the University as crews rushed around the route to (in typical Venezuelan fashion) cut the lawns, clean up garbage, re-tile a boulevard, and even build the stage at the last possible hour. Despite the rush, everything went off without a hitch. There was live music all night from a giant stage overlooking Los Proceres, the famous Caracas rally location. In the parade were delegations representing dozens of countries all over the world, from Sweden to Japan. There were over 50,000 people in the parade, but it appeared tiny in the massive Los Proceres. It is difficult to imagine the Chavista demonstrations of two million plus which not only packed the square, but flowed into surrounding streets. If there's one thing the Chavistas know how to do, it's putting on a rally. The most massive speakers I've ever seen are common, and a huge stage, as grand as any music festival can be erected in a day. The military is very efficient at herding the gathered crowds, and it's comforting to know that for once, the instruments of the state stand shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses. Walking through this part of the city, I gained a new and even more profound appreciation for how beautiful Caracas must have been before falling into neglect and disrepair. There are richly tiled boulevards everywhere, filled with monuments and sculptures. Large trees line the streets, hanging down over narrow roads. Everything is built in a grand manner, to give an impression not unlike the great cities of Europe. I will have to come back and visit again after the revolution advances to see the city returned to its full splendor, as labour once again is directed towards great projects instead of day to day survival. Early this afternoon, Hands Off Venezuela, led by the British delegation, held a forum about their international solidarity work with the Bolivarian Revolution. It took place at the Grande Salon in the Hilton Caracas, and was well attended by activists from across the globe, filling the conference hall to near capacity. Speakers including London HOV activist Rob Sewell took the stage and gave reports on their successes and future aspirations for the revolution both here in Venezuela as well as around the world. As the speeches went on, excitement about HOV's solidarity work filled the hall, and most who were present in the room signed up to keep in touch with the HOV section in each of their countries.

													Alon Lessel in Israel","On December 12, the first meeting in defence of the revolution in Venezuela and the left-wing regime of Hugo Chavez took place in Israel. The meeting was organised by the Israeli supporters of the “Hands Off Venezuela” (HOV) campaign and the Venezuelan ambassador in Israel. The meeting was organised to promote the new book published by the Israeli In Defense of Marxism circle, In Defence of the Revolution in Cuba and Venezuela by Yossi Schwartz. The International Marxist Tendency, which the In Defense of Marxism circle is a part of, was instrumental in launching HOV in December 2002. This followed the April coup organised by anti-Chavez reactionaries, and HOV was set up to organise solidarity activity with Hugo Chavez's left-wing government, to tell the truth about what was really happening in Venezuela and to campaign against intervention on the part of the counter-revolution supported by the USA and other imperialist forces. Since then, the organization has grown worldwide, and has made some impressive achievements, such as pro-Venezuela protests, and unanimous motions in support of the revolution in different trade-unions (for example, in Britain, the Basque country, Ontario in Canada). The meeting was part of an effort to create an HOV group in Israel as well. When we arrived at the ambassador's home, there were already several people there, including HOV supporter Asher Frohlich, the ambassador himself, and In Defense of Marxism members Yossi Schwartz and myself. In all, there were between 30 to 35 people present, and it was obvious that everyone was interested in the revolution, not out of any intellectual interest, but because everyone understood that a successful revolution in Venezuela would completely change the life of all humans, not only there, but all over the world. The first speech was in English and was given by comrade Frohlich. Frohlich explained that due to the development of capitalism, we no longer live in a world in which what happens in one country does not affect another country. In today's world, he explained that what happens in Venezuela, although far away geographically, still affects Israel. He explained the importance of Chavez's election and that the entire world, including Israel, can learn from what's taking place in Venezuela, which will undoubtedly affect all our lives in the coming period. After a short speech in Spanish by the ambassador, Yossi Schwartz, a member of In Defense of Marxism and a supporter of HOV, gave a speech. Schwartz explained why, from a historical point of view, the revolutionary process is taking place in Venezuela, and explained why this process is seen as a threat by imperialist governments everywhere. He explained that Venezuela is an example to the masses of all countries of a situation where the masses have risen up off their knees and have begun to take control of events in their country and they are using this to improve their lives. ""We must all think of Venezuela as our homeland"", he said. After him I gave a speech. After greeting everyone and thanking all those present for coming, I read out a motion that the British comrades of HOV had managed to get passed at the TUC congress earlier this year, and I explained that in our opinion, now that many Israelis are finally waking up politically, it is time to set up an HOV group in Israel, that can carry out similar solidarity activity. What stood out at this meeting was its internationalism. Four languages were spoken at the meeting, Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish, and English, and despite the difficulties in understanding one another – it took two translators in order for everyone to understand what everyone was saying – everyone got along and were aware of their common class interests, which take precedent over all national barriers. True internationalists understand that there is a problem regarding language and that communicating with people from different nationalities can be problematic, but they endeavour to overcome all these problems and to co-operate with their brothers and sisters from all over the world. Most people stayed on for at least another hour and discussed all sorts of matters. You could feel the excitement in the air, and not one of us had any doubt that we were doing something right, something essential, something that can change the lives of many for the better. We invite all those who support the goals of the revolutionary process in Venezuela to join HOV and to help us with the important task of getting support for this process from the Israeli labour movement.",NA,NA

			Two reports from the World Social Forum in Caracas",2006-01-25T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Canada","We have received these two reports from Hands Off Venezuela Canada delegates to the World Social Forum in Caracas in Venezuela. They give both a personal and a political view on events in Venezuela. Caracas is a city unlike any other in the world. Unlike in Canadian urban centres, the population of Caracas is brimming with political and revolutionary energy. In the Cafes, restaurants and bars, the pleasant Latino music is overwhelmingly drown out by the constant sounds of political debate and discussion. Virtually every open surface on walls, streets, trees and even cars and trucks is covered with revolutionary graffiti and messages. The government ministries have brand new banners across their fronts reading ""Forward to Socialism"". Murals of Bolivar, Che, Marx and Chavez stand out on practically every major avenue. The Forum has barely started and the international delegates are already fully aware of the huge difference in mindset that exists amongst the masses of Venezuela. Said one member of the Canadian delegation on his third trip to the country, ""It is very clear to me that this revolution truly belongs to the people, to the poor, not to any sort of government official or strong man."" Locals come up to the delegate quizzically asking, ""Chavista?"" Which of course receives an enthusiastic affirmative response, resulting in cheers from every Venezuelan within earshot. ""Ground Zero"" of the revolution is indeed an experience that shocks the system and shows social progressives what the path to real change looks like. Educational workshops begin tomorrow all over the city, with over 100,000 participants attending thousands of events and lectures. One of the largest events to be held is a workshop on Workers Control being presented by Marxist.com and featuring Orlando Chirino, general secretary of the UNT, as the keynote speaker. Many Venezuelans, it is clear, realize that their revolution is not yet complete. There is still a huge disparity between the rich and the poor in Caracas. As one looks at the wall of the city, the more recent the graffiti is, the more radical the message. Graffiti from the referendum like “Vota No”, is fading and is being replaced with messages like “Bolivar, Marx, Socialismo!” The awareness of the masses of their revolution is huge, they know it belongs to them and they know only they can carry it forward, and there is no sign that the workers, youth and poor of Venezuela are ready to back down. As the forum carries on, the workshops will provide both education and an outlet for voicing different view amongst foreign and local activists, which should provide a window into the future of the Venezuela and the revolution. Julian Benson Hands Off Venezuela Ontario (Canada) Revolutionary Greetings from Venezuela, It's quite extraordinary being here, I don't know where to start, but I'll try to leap into a few of the most interesting bits. For one thing, society here is far from transformed. The gaps between rich and poor are more glaring then anything I've ever seen. The rich eastern part of the city looks alot like Toronto but with more street vendors. It's modern, clean, filled with trees, and well dressed people. The west on the other hand, where we're spending our time, has clearly had no money whatsoever put into it in the last 30 years or so. The roads have holes, tiled or brick sidewalks have very few tiles or bricks left (I'd assume they were used to build homes), and many buildings are missing entire floors. For example, one long apartment building has the bottom three floors or so simply missing and looks like it's sitting on stilts, with only the concrete pillars left. People here are also absolutely paranoid about security. Big steel doors you'd expect to see in a medium security prison are everywhere. For example, in the building we're staying in, we have to go through four big steel doors just to get in. To top it all off, the locks are in awful shape, and we've often ended up taking five minutes of jiggling the key to get through just one of them. The building also has a broken buzzer system, and the hot water doesn't work anywhere in the building (including the restaurants downstairs). It's fairly clear that the last plumber here just clamped shut the hot water pipes for the whole building and left it at that. It gives showers the feeling of a polar-bear swim. These neighbourhoods were clearly cutting edge back in the 70s, the match of ANY Canadian city at the time. For example, a comrade's apartment, which is in a very bad part of town now, has a massive patterned mirror covering the living-room wall, mohagany frames around interior doors, and despite being only two bedroom, it has two bathrooms as well. Unfortunately, it is as everywhere in complete disrepair. When I was taking a shower there after first arriving, the water went down the shower drain, and then came back up the floor drain in the other bathroom and ended up flooding the hallway. However, there is great hope here, to an extent that can't possibly sink in without seeing it first hand. There is graffiti everywhere, but out of all of it, I haven't seen one tag that wasn't either a political slogan such as 'Forward to Socialism' (can't remember the translation) or an election add (lots of 'Vota No' signs still). One tag we saw in a barrio read 'Chavez Bolivar Marx Socialismo'. It is truly inspiring. These barrios are on the way from the airport to the city along the old highway, and have piles of garbage everywhere and raw sewage in ditches. The houses in these areas are precariously perched on the sides of mountains and look like the slightest wind would knock them down. They are mostly made of flimsy, hollow bricks. In one of those barrios, there was a little canopy setup beside the road with three or four people sitting on lawn chairs underneath and a sign on the front that said 'Parliamentary Office'. I wish I could have gotten a photo of that and will have to try on the way back. Speaking of photos, last night I picked up a little disposable camera with 37 exposures, so I'll have photos when I get back, but can't send them digitally from here. I've taken two so far (one of a big mural with a hammer and sickle and another of a small vegetable farm in an abandoned lot in the middle of the city), and I'm trying to be careful so hopefully out of the 37, at least 25 or so should be good. People here really know how to cook. The food is incredible, if you are careful to avoid things which have been sitting out too long. Beer costs less then $1, and we bought tall glasses of Scotch Whiskey for about 50c Canadian... so the exchange rate is quite nice... for us gringos anyway. People in the west of the city (poorer part, but not a barrio) are generally very nice. When you pass a group of people talking on the street, it's about 50/50 odds or so you'll hear them talking about politics. It's incredible how drastically the mass consciousness of the people can change. It's something that I understand dialectically and have for a while, but seeing it in person is none the less remarkable. In the east, it's a different story. People generally are very rude, and seem pissed right off that the Social Forum is here. There is also alot of theft in that area. Just yesterday, Julian got taken for $30 by two very friendly con-men/thiefs. The murder rate here is also extremely high (something like 10,000 killed PER YEAR), and we've seen evidence of that. For example, next to one fast-flowing rain-water canal, we saw a complete set of woman's clothing and a purse. I hate to think about what happened to the former owner. One interesting (and telling) tidbit is that there are actually considerably fewer homeless people here compared to any large Canadian city. It's true that the barrios are all squatters, but it just rubs in the ridiculousness of how we don't allow people to build a house on abandoned land in Canada. Well, that's it for now, I'll try to get to a computer again before too many days (though I'm sure the schedule will be nasty for it), and I'll see you all in a week.

													Hands Off Venezuela","The British Communication Workers Union recently published an article written by Rob Sewell, titled ""Venezuela: The Revolution of the Poor"". Hands Off Venezuela welcomes this move and we hereby reproduce the article as found on the CWU website . 09 January 2006 By Rob Sewell Those fortunate enough to have seen the documentary “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” on Channel Four will have witnessed dramatic events unfolding in the small Latin American country of Venezuela. The masses have regularly taken to the streets in support of their President, Hugo ChÃ¡vez , a man pledged to emancipate the downtrodden of Venezuela. Workers have occupied factories under workers’ control (“cogestion”). Landless peasants have taken over landed estates, including that of Lord Vesty, the British millionaire who owned a chain of butchers. The world, it seems, has been turned on its head! As always, the United States Administration is attempting to intervene to crush this popular revolution, described as a “revolution of the poor”, in order to protect its “national interests” south of the border. Washington was behind the failed military coup to topple the democratically elected government of Hugo ChÃ¡vez in April 2002, graphically captured on the Channel Four documentary. This was followed by a bosses’ lockout to bring the economy crashing down and a referendum campaign to oust the President, both of which failed. Now there is talk in the US of assassinating Chavez, seen as a cheaper alternative to full-scale invasion. But the revolution is gaining increasing support. Venezuela is immensely rich in oil, the fifth largest exporter, but in the past this oil wealth only filled the pockets of the wealthy elite. Eighty percent lived in poverty. Now that is changing. In the course of 2003, huge sums of oil money were redirected into social programmes. One million people have been taught to read and illiteracy abolished. With the help of Cuba, 20,000 doctors have been dispatched into the towns and villages to dispense free healthcare. Education has been opened up. Subsidies cheap food has been made available and work programmes established. ChÃ¡vez has even offered - and is now supplying - cheap fuel during the winter to the poor of the United States, to the dismay of the Bush Administration, which regards it as a “communist ploy”. Since the beginning of 2005, the revolution has lurched to the left, as millions take part in political life. Everywhere you go people are discussing politics. They are proud to show you the copies of the new Constitution, passed in 1999 by popular referendum, possibly the most democratic in the world, which allows all officials, including the President, to be recalled. Speaking to the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in January 2005, ChÃ¡vez put the idea of socialism on the agenda for the first time. He has repeated his socialist message over the last year at every opportunity and called for a nation-wide debate on the socialist alternative. “I am convinced”, stated ChÃ¡vez, “and I think that this conviction will be for the rest of my life, that the path to a new, better world, is not capitalism, the path is socialism, that is the path: socialism, socialism.” This radicalism has found a ready response, not least in the workers’ movement. The old Venezuelan trade unions, the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, never embraced more than 12 percent of the workforce. They were very corrupt and linked to the old ruling party AcciÃ³n DemocrÃ¡tica. The body became widely discredited as a bosses’ union, with links to the employers’ federation, and funds coming from the US National Endowment for Democracy, an organ of the US Congress. The CTV leadership consistently opposed ChÃ¡vez and supported the old bankrupt opposition, even going so far as to back the military coup in April 2002 and the bosses’ lockout. Carlos Orgeta, the leader of the CTV, went into exile after the coup failed, but has now been charged with treason and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Elections were held within the CTV in October 2001, but were viewed as rigged. Under the circumstances, members split away to form a new democratic trade union federation, the National Union of Workers (the UNT). This marked a big step forward for the Venezuelan working class, who have become increasingly involved in the revolution, especially since the bosses’ lockout. The aim of the lockout was to paralyse the oil industry, the hub of the Venezuelan economy, and force ChÃ¡vez to resign. “Christmas without ChÃ¡vez” was the opposition slogan. Directors, managers and specialists withdrew their labour, but only after programming computers to pay their salaries automatically! The initial disruption caused by the sabotage of the oil industry resulted in electricity blackouts, oil scarcity, and transport dislocation. Ordinary workers rallied to break the lockout. Starting with the oil industry, they took charge of restarting production. The prerogatives of management fell into the hands of the workers for some 62 days, who proved in practise that industry could be run without bosses. A truly remarkable state of affairs! The economic sabotage still continued with factories being closed down or deliberately run down. Workers were laid off and unemployment rose. Under these conditions, workers began to demand action from the government. But some did not wait, and began to occupy empty factories and restart production. Workers at an abandoned paper mill - called Venepal - after a two-year struggle had occupied their plant and demanded the state nationalise the company under workers’ control. In January 2005, ChÃ¡vez nationalised Venepal under decree 3438. This was followed by further nationalisations. The movement of occupied factories has spread throughout the continent. So much so that in October the first Latin American Gathering of Worker Recovered Factories was held in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Four hundred workers from 235 occupied factories were present to share their experiences, including workers’ control. President ChÃ¡vez was present at the 3,000-strong rally and spoke of his support for the UNT, but adding, “it should not and it should never be an appendix of the government, it must be autonomous and free.” When he announced further nationalisations, he was met with a standing ovation and shouts “asi, asi, asi es que se gobierna” (“this is the way to govern”). This Revolution of the Poor is not yet finished. In many ways it has only just begun. From Venezuela, the message is clear: another world is possible. “We have shown how the workers can run the companies”, stated Ricardo Moreira, “and this means we can run society as well.” For those wanting more information go to www.handsoffvenezuela.org ",NA,NA

			Hands Off Venezuela: Building London-Caracas Solidarity at the 2006 World Social Forum",2006-01-20T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Charley Allan - www.handsoffvenezuela.org","From 23rd January the Venezuelan people will be hosting a huge celebration of democracy, with a national demonstration starting off a week of grassroots participatory internationalism, the World Social Forum. Monday's annual mega-demo, which in recent years has evolved into a carnival of ""Bolivarian"" (Venezuela's mass movement) liberation, commemorates the 1958 overthrow of Perez Jimenez, who is often incorrectly referred to as the country's last dictator. (Venezuela's last dictator was 2002 coup-leader Pedro Carmona, although his reign was quite brief.) The rest of the week will be a unique opportunity to participate in Venezuela's peaceful and democratic revolution, and experience how ""another world is possible"". The World Social Forum is a massive meeting of minds as autonomous, non-hierarchical, horizontally-organised groups and individuals come together and build open space to share experiences and strategies in the fight-back against corporate imperialism and neo-colonialism. Many activists from the global Peace and Justice movements, including Londoners from international solidarity campaign Hands Off Venezuela, will be visiting this beautiful country for the first time, with over 100,000 participants expected during the week. Caracas is the perfect city from which to start this revolutionary journey: a lush, tropical metropolis, where a valley of skyscrapers is surrounded by richly colourful mountains, many of which are covered with house after house stacked precariously on top of one another - poor neighbourhoods known as barrios. Until recently, these humble communities were starved of resources and run by gangsters; now the government is helping the people by rebuilding homes and roads and providing new schools, clinics, cheap supermarkets and funding for local cooperatives, as well as free internet access and communal kitchens. La Vega is a case in point. A sprawling barrio in the southwest of the capital, the steep streets are alive with culture, activity and anticipation. Freshly repaired and repainted houses sit atop busy stores selling locally-produced goods. Crime has gone down although so has police presence. People are friendly and organised; they've had to defend their democracy on several occasions and are prepared to do so again. At the peak of the mountain is the community Las Casitas - in some ways a showcase model of regeneration. Everything is where it should be: the Bolivarian school, the ""Barrio Adentro"" health clinic, the Mercal supermarket, the Infocentre, a new bakery, organic garden, etc, all surrounding a busy basketball court. Quite apart from the stunning views the air is far cleaner than the smog-filled middle-class valley below. This neighbourhood is the home to media cooperative Calle y Media, makers of both ""Venezuela Bolivariana: People & Struggle of the 4th World War"" and more recently ""The Old Man & Jesus: Prophets of Rebellion."" The co-op's latest project is a Media School, which teaches local children about filmaking, theatre, internet and radio, as well as traditional print-press. They are ""building the communication skills necessary to defend and deepen our revolution,"" according the Marcelo Andrade, director of both documentaries, who was recently in London. Hands Off Venezuela has helped raise money for this school and co-op, mainly through screening and distributing their films. During the WSF, the co-op and community will be developing an ""organic"" programme to complement the other activities, similar to their alternative youth camp during August's World Festival of Youth & Students event. Solidarity campaigners from London, who visited the community in August and discussed the grassroots activities they too were involved in back home, will return in January to be part of the movement there again. They are organising a workshop on ""Hands Off Venezuela: Building International Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution"" within the official forum, but much of that solidarity work will take place outside of the conference-room as campaigners meet and share experiences with Bolivarians on the ground. Other international activists will be able to take advantage of the contacts and knowledge the group has built up, which may prove especially useful to newcomers who only speak English. Hands Off Venezuela will also have a stall in the Hilton Hotel (which is now run as a co-op) alongside many other groups from around the world. The geographical focus for many participants, however, will be the ""global youth"" camp in the stunning Parque del Este. For a modest fee ($12 for people from rich countries, $7 others) delegates will be able to pitch a tent, share a communal kitchen or buy meals prepared by local co-ops, and participate in a wide range of cultural and political activities including concerts, plays and films. Although situated in the more affluent east of the city, the park is a simple bus or metro journey (and even within walking distance) to the main central festival venues, clustered around the Teresa Carreño Theatre and Hilton co-op in the Parque Central district, a largely pedestrianised zone also home to the festival offices. To the west of this complex is the presidential palace Miraflores, and beyond that the ""January 23rd"" borough, a barrio which has been reclaimed by the community for many years and which has lead the way for urban renewal. This is also one of the locations of the ""troll party,"" a hi/lo-tek celebration of open-source or ""free"" software, jointly-organised by international programmers and the SAPI ministry of the Venezuelan government. From the beginning of this year, all government agencies have to migrate to open-source within two years, and although SAPI is technically concerned with ""Intellectual Property"" the director-general has said that it should instead be promoting ""Intellectual Prosperity"". Property or prosperity? It's clear which is more important to the Venezuelan people and their government, as well as those coming to the WSF. Another world really is possible - and in Venezuela they're making it a reality.

			Hands Off Venezuela Hosts UNT leader’s visit to Britain",2005-12-08T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Rob Sewell (HOV National Steering Committee)","Hands Off Venezuela has been in the forefront of promoting links between the Venezuelan and British trade unions. The campaign was instrumental in getting a motion on Venezuela debated and passed unanimously at the TUC. Ruben's visit helped to consolidate and deepen this important work. Ruben was then invited to address the Executive Committee of the RMT at Unity House. He had already spoken at the National Conference of the union in July, and this visit to the Executive constituted a follow up. After a warm welcome from Bob Crow, the General Secretary, and Tony Donaghy, the President, Ruben outlined the political background to events in Venezuela. “For the working class”, stated Ruben, “the counter-revolution of April 2002 was of decisive importance. It shook up the whole of society. The coup was defeated by a spontaneous movement of the workers and oppressed. They were not called upon by any party to take to the streets. There was no leadership. It was simply spontaneous.” Then the counter-revolution tried economic sabotage, a bosses' lockout. “But again the workers rose up to defend the revolution”, said Ruben. “The attack centred on Pdvsa, the oil company, as it was the life-line of the country. The managers sabotaged production. But the workers responded by restarting the refineries without the bosses. In other words”, said Ruben, “the workers didn't need the bosses. We could run the industry without them”, a point that went down well amongst members of the Executive, who nodded in agreement. Ruben explained that workers' control of the oil industry, the key sector in the economy, lasted some 65 days. It demonstrated the ability and power of the working class. Nevertheless, Ruben also gave an honest appraisal of the revolution and pointed to the dangers of bureaucratism. “We need to fight against this”, he said. “However, the prospect opening up was that of a socialist revolution in Venezuela.” After some interesting questions, ranging from the solidarity work to workers' cooperatives, Ruben summed up the discussion on an optimistic note. “Within the next few years, we will hold a referendum about the character of the revolution. From which we will emerge as the 'Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela'.” Ruben then visited the TUC at Congress House to discuss with representatives from the international department. The subjects discussed dealt with the ILO deliberations on Venezuela and the attempts of the CTV, the old corrupt unions, and the employers to attack Venezuela over trade union freedoms. The issue of the official TUC delegation to Venezuela in February was also discussed, as well as the UNT conference and elections also due in the New Year. Ruben also managed to meet briefly with Brendan Barber, the General Secretary of the TUC, who welcomed closer links between both countries. After this, Ruben visited the House of Commons where John McDonnell MP had arranged a meeting with MPs. He outlined the history of the Venezuelan revolution beginning with the Caracazo in February 1989, which led to government repression and the loss of some 5,000 lives. “It was the first expression of anger against the IMF-imposed policies that existed below the surface”, explained Ruben. He dealt with the Chavez military rebellion “for justice” in 1992, which involved many young officers disgusted by the regime. Finally, Chavez was elected president in 1998 with a landslide victory and a new constitution was adopted. The old parties, based on the oligarchy, were discredited. Ruben outlined events surrounding the 2002 coup and lockout. The masses had changed everything. Again, it was a spontaneous movement from below. It began the real Bolivarian Revolution. “We have been squeezed by the World Bank and the multinationals, but now we are taking to the road of socialism”, he said. “This is our socialism of the 21st century.” MPs pledged to defend the Venezuelan revolution by putting pressure on the Labour government. The government is opposed to the illegal blockade of Cuba, it must be made to do the same for Venezuela, stated a number of MPs. A group of MPs were to meet with a Foreign Office Minister, who would raise the question of Venezuela. Lastly, Ruben was taken to Kingston Upon Thames to visit the headquarters of the Fire Brigades Union. Here he spoke to the Executive Committee of the FBU. Ruben again outlined the gains of the Bolivarian Revolution and placed the revolution in the context of socialism. Ruben explained the movement of factory occupations and the conference which had taken place a few weeks earlier. “With these bankruptcies, which were instigated by multinationals in Britain, the workers had to act”, he said. The whole country is debating socialism everyday. “The people have never read Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky or Rosa Luxemburg”, said Ruben, “many have not finished primary education, but we are debating socialism and revolution.” Again he believed that in the near future the country will call itself the Socialist Republic of Venezuela and this would open up a new chapter for the working class of Latin America. In his conclusion Ruben attacked Thatcher for her privatisation programme, which is being continued by Tony Blair, who he described as a “bourgeois infiltrator in the labour movement”. Once again, everyone present visibly appreciated this remark. Ruben was warmly thanked by Ruth Winters, the President, and Matt Wrack, the General Secretary, and expressed the desire of the union to build links with their sister unions in Venezuela. All in all, it was an extremely successful visit by the representative of the UNT. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign has to step up its work to publicise what is taking place in Venezuela. The organising of speaking tours of leading trade unionists from Venezuela is an important aspect of this solidarity work. Ruben Linares publicly thanked the HOV campaign for is contribution and pledged to help the campaign in whatever way he could. December 8, 2005",NA,NA

			Statement from the Hands Off Venezuela Preparatory Committee",2005-12-14T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","We publish the following statement which was issued by the British Hands Off Venezuela Steering Committee at the HoV National Conference on December 3. The Venezuelan Revolution has made great strides forward in the recent period. Once again, the new elections taking place will demonstrate overwhelming support for Hugo ChÃ¡vez and the progressive policies being pursued by his government. Up until now, President ChÃ¡vez has passed the electoral test eight times in six years, a record unparalleled in Latin America. So much for the propaganda of the opposition and their imperialist allies that the President is a “dictator”, “undemocratic”, and so forth! These popular policies have not only included the Missions, which have transformed the lives of millions in the realms of education, healthcare, and other matters, but have promoted land reform, the expropriation of factories, as well as democratic workers’ control and management. The Revolution has brought millions of Venezuelans to their feet for the first time. It has politicised them and aroused their expectations of a new life. This has gone hand in hand with ChÃ¡vez’s denunciation of capitalism and his strong support for socialism not only in Venezuela, but also throughout the world. The discredited opposition has tried everything to overthrow President ChÃ¡vez: a coup d’ é tat in April 2002, a bosses’ lockout of December 2002 and early 2003, and the recall referendum campaign of August 2004. Each of these attempts of counter-revolution had the backing of the local oligarchy and behind them, United States imperialism. These attempts were smashed by the marvellous spontaneous movement of the Venezuelan masses, which has thrown the opposition into complete disarray. However, the very successes of the Revolution have made the counter-revolution extremely desperate. The views of Pat Robertson, who has promoted the idea of the assassination of Chavez, are not accidental. They reflect the views of sections of the Venezuelan opposition and also the Bush administration. The imperialist powers, starting with the United States, will never be reconciled to the Venezuelan Revolution, in the same way as they can never be reconciled to the Cuban Revolution. They represent symbols of resistance and advance for the downtrodden masses of Latin America. The Bush administration is attempting to isolate Venezuela, while ChÃ¡vez is correctly trying to break this isolation. Their continual attacks on ChÃ¡vez and his government are an attempt to intimidate and harass the Venezuelan Revolution, hoping to prepare the climate for its overthrow. The US economic and military assistance for the Colombian regime of Alvaro Uribe under ‘Plan Colombia’ is nothing more than an attempt to use Colombia as a staging post for counter-revolution within Latin America. If the USA cannot directly intervene militarily in Venezuela, as they have their hands full in Iraq, Bush may attempt to push Colombia (armed by the US) into a war with Venezuela. We are fully conscious that the Revolution is under threat. The crushing of the Venezuelan Revolution would mean a devastating blow to the progressive forces throughout Latin America and internationally. It would have extremely serious consequences for the Cuban Revolution. Under these circumstances, the survival of the Revolution is a life or death question. In Britain, we pledge to do our utmost to rally all progressive opinion in defence of the Venezuelan Revolution and against its enemies. Above all, we will help to rally the labour and trade union movement to actively assist in this defence, starting with the recognition of the UNT as the legitimate voice of the Venezuelan working class. Ever since its foundation in 2002, the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, despite its meagre resources, fought to break the media blackout around Venezuela. It has raised the question of the Venezuelan Revolution in the trade union movement, at branch, district, regional and national level. Through its sterling work over these years, HOV succeeded in getting support for Venezuela on the agenda of the TUC last September. Historically, the TUC unanimously supported the resolution submitted by NATFHE. This was the first time that a national trade union federation in the Western Hemisphere endorsed the revolution in Venezuela. This was a tremendous success for which HOV can be truly proud, and was thanked publicly by Hugo ChÃ¡vez. We now call upon the TUC to honour its pledge to “build and work with trade union endorsed organisations in the UK working to provide solidarity to Venezuela.” (Motion 79) This conference is not the end, but simply the beginning of taking the message of the Venezuelan Revolution into every corner of the trade union movement, into every school, college, and university. We must seek affiliations from all progressive bodies to the HOV campaign. Every trade unionist attending this conference must pledge themselves to submit a model resolution to their branch to go to next year’s trade union conference. Every student must commit themselves to go back to their school or college to set up a HOV society. Everyone attending this conference must pledge themselves to return to their town or community to establish a HOV committee so that this vital work can be put on an organised footing. We are enormously inspired by the example of the Venezuelan Revolution. We recognise that the fight for emancipation in Venezuela is our fight. We call on all progressive people – trade unionists and workers, youth and students, intellectuals and artists - to join with us in this great cause. We, delegates to this national conference of Hands Off Venezuela in London, salute the Venezuelan Revolution and send our warmest greetings to President Hugo ChÃ¡vez and the revolutionary people of Venezuela.

													Miriam Martin, Vancouver, BC","Following some major successes in both Alberta and Ontario (including the recent endorsement by Canada’s largest regional trade union federation, the Ontario Federation of Labour), Hands Off Venezuela has begun making inroads in the British Columbia Labour Movement. The campaign was endorsed last week by both the North Okanagan Labour Council and the South Okanagan Boundary Labour Council. Both Councils made generous donations and committed to further support the campaign, by hosting a film screening in the case of the South Okanagan, and by taking the campaign back to their respective union locals in the North. Since the 2001 election of the BC Liberals with their neo-liberal agenda, the workers of British Columbia have faced one attack after another, from devastating funding cuts and lay offs in the public sector to the gutting of the labour code and legislated contracts in all major disputes. From the BC Ferry workers to the Hospital Employees, the Telecommunications Workers, and the BC Teachers, the province’s labour movement has been thrown into struggle in recent years. But this has not made us any less aware of the struggles of our sisters and brothers around the world. On the contrary, the workers of British Columbia are more aware than ever of the global neo-liberal agenda of privatizations, contracting out, and cuts to social programs in the name of ever-increasing profit for the rich. In particular, we are following the Bolivarian Revolution, which is both an inspiration and an urgent matter for our attention and solidarity. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign was present at the recent BC Federation of Labour Convention, distributing materials and discussing with trade unionists who wish to bring the campaign to their unions for endorsement and support. The incredibly positive response from this Convention and from the Okanagan region make us confident that this is only the beginning for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in British Columbia.",NA,NA

When the film ended, Ramon explained how the revolutionary events have developed in Venezuela since the defeat of the coup d’etat in April 2002. He concluded by explaining the historical battle that workers are having to implement “co-gestion” or in other words workers' control.

			Manos Fuera de Venezuela hospeda la visita de un líder de la UNT a Gran Bretaña.",2005-12-09T00:00:00Z,NA,"La campaña Manos Fuera de Venezuela ha estado a la cabeza promoviendo lazos entre los sindicatos Venezolanos y los BritÃ¡nicos. La campaña fue vital en conseguir que una mociÃ³n sobre Venezuela fuese discutida y pasada unÃ¡nimamente en el TUC. La visita de Rubén ayudo a consolidar y profundizar este importante trabajo. Rubén fue invitado a hablar a el Comité Ejecutivo del RMT en la “Casa de la Unidad”. Ruben ya hablÃ³ en la Conferencial Nacional de este sindicato en julio y esta visita a la Ejecutiva constituyÃ³ un seguimiento a la primera. Después de una cÃ¡lida bienvenida por parte de Bob Crow, el Secretario General de este sindicato, y Tony Donaghy, el Presidente, Ruben explicÃ³ la historia de los acontecimientos que hoy ocurren en Venezuela. “Para la clase obrera”, indicÃ³ Ruben, “la contra-revoluciÃ³n de abril del 2002 fue de una importancia decisiva. SacudiÃ³ la sociedad en su totalidad. El golpe fue derrotado gracias al movimiento expontaneo de los trabajadores y los oprimidos. No fueron llamados por ningun partido a que tomasen las calles. No habÃ­a direcciÃ³n. Fue simplemente un movimiento expontaneo″. Cuando mÃ¡s tarde la contra­revoluciÃ³n intentÃ³ un sabotage econÃ³mico, el cierre patronal, “una vez mÃ¡s, los trabajadores se levantaron para defender la revoluciÃ³n”, dijo Rubén. “Los ataques fueron dirigidos hacia PDVSA, la compañÃ­a petrolera, ya que es de enorme importancia para nuestro paÃ­s. La patronal saboteÃ³ la producciÃ³n pero los trabajadores respondieron restableciendo la producciÃ³n sin los jefes, en otras palabras”, dijo Rubén, “los trabajadores no necesitaron a los jefes, podiamos dirigir la industria sin ellos”. Este punto gustÃ³ mucho a los miembros de la ejecutiva, los cuales asentian en acuerdo. Rubén explicÃ³ que el control obrero en la industria petrolera, un sector clave en la economÃ­a, durÃ³ unos 65 dÃ­as, lo cual demuestra el poder y la capacidad de la clase obrera. Aun asÃ­, Rubén también diÃ³ una valoraciÃ³n honesta de la revoluciÃ³n y señalÃ³ los peligros del burocratismo. “Tenemos que luchar contra esto”, dijo “aunque la perspectiva que se abre ante nosotros es la de una revoluciÃ³n socialista en Venezuela”. Después de varias preguntas interesantes referentes desde la solidaridad hasta las co­operativas obreras, Rubén hablÃ³, finalizando la discusiÃ³n, con una nota de optimismo. “En los siguientes años, tendremos un referendum sobre el carÃ¡cter de la revoluciÃ³n, del cual emergeremos como “RepÃºblica Socialilsta Bolivariana de Venezuela”. Rubén visito el TUC en “La Casa del Congreso” para discutir con representantes del Departamento Internacional. Los temas que se discutieron trataron la deliberaciÃ³n sobre del ILO sobre Venezuela y sobre los intentos de la CTV, los viejos sindicatos corruptos, y la patronal de atacar a Venezuela respecto a libertad sindical. El tema de una delegaciÃ³n official del TUC a Venezuela en Febrero también fue discutida, asi como el Congreso de la UNT y las elecciones pendientes para principios del año que viene. Rubén también tuvo la oportunidad de conocer brevemente a Brendan Barber, el Secretario General del TUC, el cual da la bienvenida a relaciones mÃ¡s cercanas entre ambos paises. Después de esto, Rubeén visitÃ³ la CÃ¡mara de los Comunes, donde el parlamentario John McDonnell habÃ­a preparado una reuniÃ³n con otros parlamentarios. Rubén hablÃ³ sobre la historia de la RevoluciÃ³n en Venezuela, empezando con el Caracazo en febrero del 1989, lo cual llevo a represiÃ³n por parte del gobierno que llevÃ³ a la perdida de mas de 5000 vidas. “Fue la primera expresiÃ³n de ira hacia las politicas impuestas por el FMI que existÃ­an bajo la superficie”, explicÃ³ Ruben. HablÃ³ sobre la rebellion militar de ChÃ¡vez, “por justicia”, en 1992, en la cual participaron numerosos oficiales jÃ³venes descontentos con el sistema. Finalmente ChÃ¡vez fue elegido presidente en 1998 con una gran victoria y una nueva constituciÃ³n fue adoptada. Los viejos partidos basados en la oligarquÃ­a fueron desacreditados. Rubén enfatizÃ³ los acontecimientos alrededor del golpe y el cierre patronal del 2002. “Las masas lo cambiaron todo. Una vez mÃ¡s, fue un movimiento expontaneo desde abajo. Con esto empezÃ³ la RevoluciÃ³n Bolivariana real. Hemos sido exprimidos por el Banco Mundial y por las multinacionales, pero ahora estamos tomando el camino del socialismo”, dijo Rubén, “Este es nuestro socialismo del siglo XXI”. Los parlamentarios se comprometieron a defender la revoluciÃ³n en Venezuela poniendo presiÃ³n en el gobierno Laborista. “El gobierno se opone al bloqueo ilegal de Cuba, debe hacer lo mismo con Venezuela,” indicaron un nÃºmero de parlamentareos. Un grupo de parlamentareos que se van a encontrar con el Ministro de la Oficina de Asuntos Exteriores van a presentarle la cuestiÃ³n de Venezuela. Por Ãºltimo, Rubén fue a “Kingston Upon Thames” para visitar las oficinas del sindicato de bomberos. HablÃ³ con el Comité Ejecutivo del FBU (sindicato de bomberos). Una vez mÃ¡s Ruben enfatizÃ³ los logros de la RevoluciÃ³n Bolivariana y puso esta revoluciÃ³n en el contexto del Socialismo. Rubén hablÃ³ sobre el movimiento de la toma de fÃ¡bricas y sobre la conferencia que tuvo lugar unas semanas atrÃ¡s. “Con estas bancarrotas, que han sido instigados por multinacionales en Gran Bretaña, los trabajadores tienen que actuar”, dijo Rubén, “El paÃ­s enteroestÃ¡ debatiendo sobre el socialismo a diario. La gente nunca ha leido Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky o Rosa Luxemburgo, muchos no han terminado la escuela primaria, pero aun asÃ­ estamos discutiendo socialismo y revoluciÃ³n”. Una vez mÃ¡s Rubén dijo que muy pronto su paÃ­s se llamarÃ¡ RepÃºblica Socialista de Venezuela y esto abrirÃ¡ un nuevo capÃ­tulo para la clase obrera de América Latina. En su conclusiÃ³n criticÃ³ a Thatcher por su programa de privatizaciÃ³n que esta siendo continuado por Tony Blair, al cual describiÃ³ como “infiltrado burgués del gobierno laborista”. Una vez mÃ¡s, los que estaban presentes estuvieron de acuerdo. Rubén fue agradecido por Ruth Winters, Presidente del sindicato de bomberos, y Matt Wrack, el Secretario General, y ambos expresaron su deseo de contruir enlaces entre sindicatos hermanos en Venezuela. En su totalidad, fue una visita extremadamente exitosa. La campaña Manos Fuera de Venezuela va a aumentar sus esfuerzos en hacer publicidad sobre lo que esta pasando en Venezuela. La organizaciÃ³n de giras de dirigentes sindicales de Venezuela es un aspecto importante de este trabajo de solidaridad. Rubén Linares agradecio publicamente a la campaña por su trabajo y prometiÃ³ ayudar a la campaña en todo cuanto le sea posible.< December 8, 2005",NA,NA

													Lukas Frey, Chairman of the Socialist Youth, Vorarlberg","100,000 participants from around the world, with the largest delegations coming from Colombia, Brazil, and the United States, are expected for the 2006 decentralized World Social Forum, to be held in Caracas, January 24 to 29. All planning is on track and the forum will take place as scheduled, despite the problems that exist with transportation to and from the airport, said the organizers during a press conference held yesterday. The Forum will involve 2,200 events to be held in 250 spaces in several complexes in Caracas’ geographic center. The events are organized around six thematic “axes”: 1. Power, politics and the fight for social emancipation; 2. Imperial strategies and resistances of peoples; 3. Resources and rights to life: alternatives to the predatory model of civilization; 4. Diversities, identities and cosmo-visions in movement; 5. Work, exploitation and reproduction of the life; and 6. Communication, cultures and education: dynamics and democratizing alternatives. Jacobo Torres, one of the organizers, who represents the Hemispheric Social Alliance, said that at no time did organizers consider suspending the Forum because of the collapse of a freeway valley bridge that allows transportation between the main Caracas airport and the city. According to Torres, visitors arriving at the airport will find information there on how to best get to Caracas. “We are fighting against al types of speculation with regard to cab fares [from the airport],” added Torres. Torres also confirmed that both Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez and Brazil’s President Lula da Silva will participate in the Forum. UCV sociology professor Edgardo Lander, one of the other members of the Forum’s organizing committee said that the Forum’s program is currently being put together, which will fit into morning, afternoon, and evening time slots on January 25 to 28. The 24th is reserved for a cultural and political event against war and imperialism. Chavez will speak in the evening of the 25th, in an event with Brazil’s landless peasants’ movement (MST). At noon of the 29th, there will be an encounter with social movements, which Chavez will attend and in the evening will be the closing event in Poliedro, a Caracas arena. Events will take place in the high school liceo Andrés Bello, Parque Central, the Teatro Teresa Carreño, Plaza Los Museos, Hotel Caracas Hilton, and Parque Los Caobos, In the Parque Los Caobos there will be 10 tents dedicated to the people of the U.S., Mercosur, ALBA (the Chavez government’s proposal for regional integration), and peasants, among other topics. Also, there will be 40 tents set up in the Carlota airport, a small air force airport in the city, for various events. All Forum participants will receive courtesy upon arrival at the main Maiquetia airport, where organizers are expecting 30,000 participants to arrive. Another 30,000 will come via land route and the rest are expected to come from within Venezuela. With regard to translation, Zuraima Martinez, another of the organizers, who represents the Coalition of Movements and Peoples of America, said that they need approximately 300 translators capable of simultaneous translation for English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Intellectuals who are to come to Venezuela for the Forum are Eduardo Galeano, Atilio Boran, Samir Amin, and Francois Utar, among others. The 2006 World Social Forum is being held on three different continents, with one in Caracas, Venezuela, another in Bamako, Mali (January 19-23, 2006), and the third in Karachi, Pakistan (March 2006).

													Cort Greene","This is the message that 27 cities from the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom are sending to the Bush administration and the United States government on December 2 ... the First International Venezuela Solidarity Day. This historic effort also includes an ongoing email campaign that has collected over 5,000 signatures and is continuing to grow. Both the day of actions and the email campaign are demanding an end to US attempts to destabilize Venezuela's democracy and its elected government. The Bush administration has portrayed Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez as a dictator and a threat to the interests of the United States. Both assertions are utterly false. Venezuelan voters have three times affirmed Chavez as their choice for leadership, have ratified a new, progressive constitution, and have repeatedly elected Bolivarian majorities to the National Assembly. A recent survey of Latin American countries shows that Venezuela has the largest majority of citizens who regard their country as ""totally democratic."" All sides agree, including those that oppose Chavez, that more people are actively involved in democratic processes than ever before. The Venezuelan government has hardly been a threat to the United States. The Venezuelan government has kept oil flowing to the US, and has offered aid to alleviate disruptions caused by both the massive electrical blackout that occurred in the Northeastern US and by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Venezuela is subsidizing cheap oil shipments to poor neighborhoods in the US and is seeking to enlarge this program. On this anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, people of the United States are stepping forward to call for an end to US neocolonial domination of the hemisphere. We are calling for a new doctrine, a doctrine of Solidarity. Participating cities include: Chicago; Minneapolis; Sydney, Australia; Washington, DC; London, England; Tucson, Arizona; Louisville; Milwaukee; San Francisco; San Jose, California; Bend, Oregon; New London, Connecticut; Vancouver; Toronto; Marin County, California; Boston; Lincoln, Nebraska; Miami; Pittsburgh; Providence, Rhode Island; Melbourne, Australia; Seattle; Rochester, New York; Fargo, North Dakota; Olympia, Washington; St. Petersburg, Florida; and St. Louis.

Ramon Samblas, spokesperson for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign gave an account of the revolutionary events taking place in Venezuela and provided an historical background to the revolution that has gripped the country and now threatens to expand throughout Latin America. Some of those in attendance reacted with surprise and joy when Ramon explained how the workers in Venezuela had defeated the counterrevolutionary attacks launched by the Venezuelan bosses with the aid of the US administration. After the talk there was a lively questions and answers session where everybody participated. Many present explained that they had been really impressed by the documentary “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised”. One of those who spoke was from Chile and established some links between the situation in Chile in the early 1970s and Venezuela today. There were a lot of proposals on how to build solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. People pledged to bring the issue to their trade unions, peace groups and offered to use their connections with progressive members of the Welsh Assembly to highlight the struggle of the working people of Venezuela.

													the Greek Committee of the International “Hands off Venezuela” Campaign","On Friday, November 25, the first public meeting of the Greek “Hands Off Venezuela” campaign was held in the centre of Athens, in the main hall of the Greek Workers’ Confederation (GSEE). This meeting was the culmination of the systematic activity of the campaign’s supporters in Greece during the last few months. The lead for the creation of the campaign was given by the Marxist Tendency in Greece and its paper, “Marxistiki Foni” (the “Marxist Voice”). Previous important steps in the activity of the campaign were the Communist Youth (KNE) festival, the festival of the Synaspismos Youth and the big workers’ rally of PAME (Communist Party wing in the trade unions). In these events the comrades of the Greek committee of the HOV campaign collected hundreds of signatures and contacted dozens of labour movement and youth activists who wanted to actively take part in the campaign. More than 70 people took part to the gathering and the audience consisted of activists of all ages. The presence of the youth was particularly intense, mostly from the Universities where the campaign has taken its first steps. Among those who took part in the meeting were left-wing members of PASOK, members of Synaspismos, representatives from DIKKI, trade unionists from PAME and other left-wing organisations, members of the SYNASPISMOS youth, of the DIKTYO (the university students linked to the SYNASPISMOS) and small delegations from organisations that take participate in SYRIZA (the wider front around the Synaspismos) and the Social Forum. Of particular importance was the presence of Dimitris Livieratos, a veteran fighter of revolutionary Marxism in Greece and a writer of political and historical books. He is also the translator and editor of the publications of many of Trotsky’s works in Greek. Theodoros Thomadakis was also present. Greetings were also sent by the coordinator of the international campaign, Alan Woods and Jorge Martin, international secretary of the HOV campaign. The first part of the meeting started with a discussion on the revolutionary developments in Venezuela and their importance. The representative of the Greek committee of “Hands off Venezuela” campaign, Stamatis Karagiannopoulos, opened the discussion. He gave a historical overview, in which he explained how things had led to the Bolivarian Revolution. Moreover, he also underlined the class and political characteristics of the policies of Hugo Chavez. His speech mainly concentrated on the active role of the working class in the revolutionary process, and he insisted on the conclusions that one can draw from this experience about the creative role of the workers. The examples of companies nationalised under workers’ control, such as INVEPAL, ALCASA and CNV are the best proof of this fact. Finally he stressed that the victory of the revolution will only come about with the passing of power to the democratic organs of the proletariat and with the socialist planning of the economy. This would be only the first step in the victory of the socialist revolution in the whole of Latin America. He ended his speech by saying, “In fighting against the provocations of imperialism, the Bolivarian revolution has only one loyal ally: the world working class and youth. Let’s take the Campaign into the trade unions and among the youth with greater determination!” The next speaker was Maria Ines Fonseca, from the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in Athens. After thanking the Greek Committee of the Campaign for the invitation and after congratulating its members for their support and active solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution, she outlined the basic the policies of Hugo Chavez, focusing on the famous “misiones”, social projects, which are the cornerstones of government policy in defending the poor layers of the people. The third and last of the speakers from the platform was George Karatsioubanis, a member of the Central Committee of the Synaspismos youth, who had recently visited Venezuela. He spoke about his impressions of the Bolivarian Revolution and he stated that Chavez’s Venezuela can become today the model of socialism with democracy and freedom, restoring the “honour” of socialism from the illiberal “socialist” models of Eastern Europe and North Korea. Moreover he gave a living picture of the revolution and he tried to transmit the mood that prevailed at the recent World Youth and Student Festival that took place in Caracas this summer. The discussion then proceeded from the floor with the interventions of G. Adamidis, who also recently visited Venezuela attending the same festival and G. Chatziantoniou, a left-wing activist and member of the “old PASOK”, who spoke with enthusiasm about the Bolivarian revolution and laid stress on the historical ties that connect Greece with the Latin American revolution. Theodoros Thomadakis also took the microphone at the end and spoke about the need for a counteroffensive on the part of the working class movement in order to repel imperialist and capitalist aggression. After the discussion the “The revolution will not be televised” was screened. The film held the full attention of the audience throughout its screening. It shows in a very vivid manner the mobilisation of the people, which brought Chavez back to power after the April 2002 “one-day coup d’etat”. It demonstrates clearly how impotent even the best-organised conspiracy of the CIA and reaction can be in the face of the dynamics of a revolution. The smiles of those watching, the optimism and militant enthusiasm carved on their faces were the best proof of the success of this event. This mood was reflected in the fact that the material produced by the Greek Committee of the Campaign and “Marxistiki Foni” was snapped up, and a lot of people asked how they could get copies of the DVD. The success of this first gathering of “Hands off Venezuela!” in Greece gives us further motivation to continue in an even more systematic manner the solidarity work of the campaign within the Greek labour movement and among the youth. After November 25 the cry of “Hands off Venezuela” is being heard even louder among the workers and youth of Greece.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Saturday December 3 rd over 200 people attended the founding conference of the British Hands Off Venezuela campaign at the main hall of the London headquarters of NATFHE – the union of lecturers in further education. It was attended by people from all over Britain. The majority were activists in the British labour and trade union movement, although there was also a large number of youth and students. On Saturday December 3 rd over 200 people attended the founding conference of the British Hands Off Venezuela campaign at the main hall of the London headquarters of NATFHE – the union of lecturers in further education. The campaign, which was set up three years ago at the time of the bosses’ economic sabotage, has expanded enormously over the last few years and is now active in over 30 countries in five continents. In Britain, HOV has been particularly successful in mobilising support in the trade unions. It organised interventions in practically every national trade union conference, culminating in the unanimous adoption of a resolution in support of the Venezuelan revolution at the congress of the TUC. The conference was held on the eve of the important legislative elections in Venezuela (on which it passed a resolution). It was attended by people from all over Britain. The majority were activists in the British labour and trade union movement, although there was also a large number of youth and students. Among those unions that sent delegates were branches of Unison, Amicus, National Union of Journalists, Transport and General, the rail unions, RMT and Aslef, as well as Community, Natfhe, and the FBU. On the platform were a number of key figures in the British labour and trade union movement: Tony Benn, the veteran leader of the Labour Party Left, and the Labour members of parliament, John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn, leaders of the left wing Campaign Group of Labour MPs; Alan Woods, editor of Socialist Appeal and founder of Hands Off Venezuela’s international campaign; Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists; Maire Daley of the national executive of NATFHE and Ruth Winters, the national President of the Firefighters’ union, FBU. The Conference also heard greetings from the Venezuelan Ambassador, Alfredo Toro Hardy, who greeted the marvellous work of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in winning the support of the British trade union movement. In his opening remarks the chairperson, John McDonnell, made it clear that Venezuela was moving towards a socialist revolution. “In the past the Left organized solidarity campaigns after a defeat, as in Chile. Now, for once, we are organizing a campaign to prevent the defeat of the Venezuelan Revolution”, he said. “This is a great opportunity for us all. The threats are great. The international labour movement must stand shoulder to shoulder with this revolutionary movement.” He continued, “This is a potential socialist revolution, not simply a democratic revolution, which we need to promote and develop.” John appealed to everyone present to carry the news of this meeting to every part of the labour movement and every part of the country. Tony Benn opened the debate attacking the USA for its attempts to dominate Latin America, referring to the Monroe Doctrine and the theory of “Manifest Destiny”. He reminded the Conference that, despite its supposed support for democracy, the USA had supported the most brutal dictatorships in Latin and Central America in order to defend the profits of the big multinational companies. “The United States seems very strong, but in reality it is very weak. Its imperialist adventure in Iraq and elsewhere has made it the most unpopular country in the world.” He praised the democratic character of the Venezuelan Revolution, which is a source of tremendous inspiration to the entire world: “When I get up in the morning feeling a bit depressed about the state of the world, I think about Venezuela and feel a new confidence.” Alan Woods, who spoke next, pointed out the contradiction that in a period where the productive forces, science and technique were sufficiently developed to solve all the problems of humanity, eight million men, women and children die each year because they do not have enough money to live. “After the collapse of the Soviet Union the supporters of capitalism imagined that socialism and revolution were off the agenda. But the Venezuelan revolution is the final answer to all this”, he said. Alan pointed out that in order to be the President of the USA one had to be a billionaire, whereas Venezuela had the most democratic constitution in the world and President Chavez had won more democratic elections and constitutions than any other leader. Yet the enemies of the Revolution claim it is “undemocratic” and have invented a new term “elected autocracy”. “We must ask ourselves what the effects of a defeat in Venezuela would be. It would isolate Cuba and place it in grave danger, it would deal a serious blow to the morale of the masses who are fighting to liberate themselves throughout Latin America, it would encourage the reactionaries to intensify their offensive against socialism on a world scale, and it would dishearten the labour movement internationally.” He warmly welcomed the declarations of Hugo Chavez in favour of socialism and called on all present to defend the Venezuelan Revolution, while at the same time fighting for socialism. Finally, he reminded the delegates of Simon Bolivar’s inspiring dream of a united Latin America. “This vision remains correct and necessary, but it can only be achieved when the working class takes power into its hands and unites in the Socialist United States of Latin America, the first step towards a Socialist World.” After the speeches there was a free, open and democratic debate in which all kinds of different opinions were expressed. Several speakers commented favourably on the complete lack of sectarianism and totally democratic way in which the Conference was run. Andy Higginbottom of the Colombia Solidarity Campaign made this point, contrasting the conduct of Hands Off Venezuela with other solidarity movements that are conducted in a narrow sectarian spirit. Andy also stressed that in order to achieve socialism, whether in Venezuela or in Britain it was essential to take on the power of the big multinational corporations. Speaking from the platform, Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn asked why the media was silent on Venezuela. The reason is that they would be compelled to report good news! “I now feel more optimistic about Latin America than for many years”, he said. In the past we had a series of defeats, like the murder of Allende in Chile or the defeat of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. He condemned the British government for backing military dictatorships in Latin America. He went on to recall the counterrevolutionary role of the USA in the invasion of Grenada and the destabilization of the PP government in Jamaica by the CIA. “The invasion of Grenada was justified on the basis that it was a threat to the United States. Tiny Grenada could not be a threat to itself, let alone the United States!” he remarked, to the laughter of many. Jeremy said that the Cuban revolution had given hope to the people of Latin America, and that it was vital to support Venezuela. Jeremy went on to refer to the revolutionary developments in the continent, not just in Bolivia and Argentina but also in Mexico, where he anticipated that Fox would be defeated in next year’s elections and replaced by Lopez Obrador. This would mean a left government on the very doorstep of the USA. The highlight of the Conference was a lengthy and impassioned speech by Ruben Linares, a national coordinator of the UNT, the main Venezuelan trade union. Ruben gave a detailed history of the Bolivarian Revolution, including an account of the counterrevolutionary coup that was defeated by the masses in April 2002, and the bosses’ economic sabotage of 2002-3. The latter, he explained, was defeated by the intervention of the working class, which moved to take over the oil installations and operate them under workers’ control. One of the most moving statements of speech came when Ruben said: “The workers do not need the bosses to run industry. They can run it themselves. And we did just that.” This statement was met with enthusiastic applause. He then went on to describe the movement for workers’ control. He reported that in a meeting called to discuss factory occupations in Latin America “grown men, hardened by everyday work in the factory, wept like little children” when they visited factories that were run by the workers. “In Argentina and Brazil, when we occupy the factories the authorities send the police to repress us. Here the government discusses how to resolve the problem.” At the end of his inspiring speech, Ruben looked forward to the day when there would be a new referendum to change the name of his country from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Socialist Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. He received a standing ovation and enthusiastic applause. Ruben Linares was followed by Maire Daley of Natfhe who welcomed the opportunity to talk about Venezuela in the trade union movement. Ruth Winters of the FBU also made an impassioned speech in favour of promoting solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution. “This issue has allowed us to raise the idea of ‘revolution’ on the conference floor of the TUC. We have a lot to learn from the Venezuelan experience. The experience of revolution is not too far away. After all, every strike is a mini revolution in reality”, she said. A trade unionist from Sinaltrainal in Columbia, Euripides Yance, representing the Food and Drink industry, denounced the murder of Columbian trade unionists and specifically pointed the finger at big multinational companies like Coca Cola. After a very rich and lively discussion, which was always friendly and comradely, the Conference unanimously approved a basic constitution and elected a steering committee to run the campaign for the next twelve months. Some amendments to expand the committee and see how best local groups can be represented nationally were also approved. The Conference was an outstanding success, particularly in view of the constant attempts to sabotage it by splitting tactics. The calling of a rival meeting on the same day by another organisation caused a very bad impression. It caused angry comments by several delegates who demanded an end to the intrigues and manoeuvres aimed at splitting the solidarity movement. Jeremy Dear, who chaired the afternoon session, assured conference that measures would be hopefully taken to ensure such things do not happen in the future. Finally, after a very good financial collection, the Conference unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attempt of the Venezuelan Opposition to sabotage the legislative elections by boycotting the polls. Jeremy Dear summed up the enthusiasm of the conference by pointing to the large number of delegates who spoke in the different sessions, bringing their experiences and different points of view. The task now was to turn out and build the campaign in every union, college, university and workplace. Once again, Ruben Linares was asked to say a few words to conclude the conference. He quoted the words of Che Guevara: “Let the ones who are born know, and let the ones who are yet born also know, revolutionaries are born to fight and we fight to win, not to be defeated”. This again brought the entire conference to its feet as a salute to the Venezuelan revolution and its success. Click here for an audio file of Tony Benn and Alan Woods speaking at the conference.

			Hands Off Venezuela up and running in Calgary, Alberta (Canada)",2005-11-30T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Canada","Hands Off Venezuela participated in two very successful events in Calgary, Alberta recently. Calgary, known as a stronghold of right wing ideas in the country, is a city in which a powerful elite has prospered from huge profits from the oil industry in Alberta. However despite being the only debt free province in Canada many Albertans are not feeling the benefits of this prosperity. Hands Off Venezuela has been working hard to promote the ideas of the Bolivarian Revolution to workers and youth in Alberta receiving endorsements from numerous notable organizations and unions including the Alberta Federation of Labour. With a strong foothold in Edmonton the campaign has now spread to Calgary starting with two events in one week. The first was organized by the Parkland Institute with HOV as a co-sponsor and featured Jonah Gindin – a Canadian journalist who lived in Venezuela for a year and a half while writing for venezuelanalysis.com. On the topic Sowing the Oil: Venezuela’s revolutionary oil policy is building a more comprehensive democracy , Gindin elaborated on the shift in Venezuela’s oil policy since Chavez has been in power and how the increased government revenues due to high oil process and increased royalty rates have been spent on social programs aimed at benefiting the majority living in poverty. After the speech was delivered there was time for some questions and discussion about the applicability of Venezuela’s oil policies to Alberta, which is among the world’s top ten oil producers. The evening then concluded with Phil Goebel, a provincial organizer for HOV making a quick announcement about a free documentary screening of “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” in Calgary later that week. About 50 people came to this event and despite a small handful of anti-Chavistas trying to derail productive discussion important points were made about the Alberta government squandering oil resources and how Albertans could learn a lot from the Venezuelan experience. A couple days later, again about 50 people, this time more youth, came to the film screening. Phil Goebel gave an introduction to the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, its activity in the province so far, as well as a brief introduction to the film. The film received a very enthusiastic response and not one person left immediately after the film was over as everyone was curious for more information. A summary of events since the April 2002 coup was given by Goebel and then he went on to speak about the current challenges that the Bolivarian Revolution faces. Questions and discussion afterwards led to the situation in Alberta and the current mismanagement of our oil resources. Lots of interest was also expressed about future HOV events and activities. Tremendous help was given by a student group in Calgary called the “Socialist Action Front” who provided the space and equipment to show the film, this dedicated group of youth are representative of the growing energy that the city of Calgary is inadvertently nurturing as aspects of the status quo are being questioned. It is not by coincidence that the ideas that the Bolivarian Revolution represents are finding such a warm welcome across Alberta. The current provincial government has shown itself completely incapable of managing the vast amount of wealth in this province. Many Albertans are beginning to understand that there are alternative options when it comes to managing our wealth. Venezuela represents an extremely important example to discuss, debate and ultimately, work towards. Although Venezuela’s example can not be followed like a formula, the ideas can be applied to the Alberta context. Hands Off Venezuela is playing a key role in providing a forum where these ideas can be discussed and the importance of the campaign is being recognized by many organizations and communities in Alberta. Many more events and activities are planned for Calgary and Hands Off Venezuela speakers and events are beginning to be requested in Alberta’s rural communities – this is the heart of right-wing conservative country, and HOV’s presence is yet another indicator of a growing dissatisfaction of the Alberta government that exists among many Albertans.",NA,NA

More than 200 delegates of the Vorarlberg section of the Austrian Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) gathered on November 12, 2005 to discuss the policies and direction of the party for the next two years. 

The shift to the left in the labour movement in Austria was palpable and was reflected in the mood of the congress. The delegates voted for the resolution put forward by the Socialist Youth (SJ) to support the Hands off Venezuela Campaign. With the passing of this resolution the SPÖ Vorarlberg expresses its solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution and supports the revolutionary Venezuelan trade union, the UNT, as the only genuine militant and anti-capitalist trade union in the country. The party also committed itself to support the international Hands off Venezuela campaign and to spread awareness about the Bolivarian Revolution in the whole of Vorarlberg.

The acceptance of this resolution is a big step forward for the local Hands off Venezuela committee organized in the Socialist Youth and for the international worker’s movement as a whole. The fact that there is strong support for the HOV campaign in this conservative region of Austria is an encouraging sign and shows that the Venezuelan revolution gives hope to a wide layer of working class people around the world.

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Saturday November 19th a solidarity meeting with Venezuela was held in Birmingham at the Friends Meeting House. The meeting was organised jointly by UNISON and Venezuela Solidarity UK. On Saturday November 19th a solidarity meeting with Venezuela was held in Birmingham at the Friends Meeting House. The meeting was organised jointly by UNISON and Venezuela Solidarity UK.

The meeting began with a showing of the excellent film by an Irish TV crew “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” For those who have not seen it, it is well worth watching as it deals with the events surrounding the attempted coup against President Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian government in April 2002. 

Of particular importance in the film is the role played by the top brass of the military and the representatives of big business in Pedro Carmona, Head of Fedecamaras, the Venezuelan CBI. They staged a coup against an elected government, dissolved the national assembly, suspended the Supreme Court, removed civil rights – and declared it a triumph for democracy! They had, however, not reckoned with the backbone of the Bolivarian revolution, the workers, unemployed, house wives, the dispossessed masses, who flooded onto the streets in their hundreds of thousands to defend Chavez and the gains of the revolution. The actions of the masses had an electrifying effect on the lower and middle ranks of the armed forces who threw their weight behind Chavez after learning that they had been duped by their senior officers and the private media who controlled all means of communication after the state channels had been seized and put off air. 47 hours after the start of the coup Chavez was back in power, the coup leaders were under arrest or has fled, and revolution had received a received a warning to consolidate and go forward to complete the tasks of removing political and economic power from the hands of the oligarchy.

The film set the scene for the opening of the discussion by Darrall Cozens, Midlands representative of HoV. He detailed the social situation of the masses of Venezuelans up to Chavez becoming president in 1998, including the Caracazo of 1989 and the failed coup of 1992. The constitution of 1999 guaranteed among other things that the natural resources of the country would belong to all of the people and would not be privatised. He outlined the three major attempts of the oligarchy, with the help of US Imperialism, to thwart the revolution – the attempted coup, the lockout in the oil industry in December 2002/January 2003 and the recall referendum of August 2004. All of these had been defeated by the mass support that the revolution enjoys. Darrall quoted Chavez remarks from a meeting in Paris in October 2005 where Chavez had been asked how he had managed to survive the coup attempt. In reply the President had said that he had relied on the support of the revolutionary masses and had quoted Trotsky when he said that the revolution sometimes need the whip of the counter-revolution to drive the process forward. The process however was not yet over.

The next speaker was Luis Morillo Baez, who for many years had been the President of the Aragua State Chapter of the CUTV (Venezuelan Communist Workers Confederation) which will probably merge with the UNT in 2006. Through an interesting and innovative computer link up called Skype, members of the audience were able to put questions to Luis who is still in Venezuela. Luis concentrated on the development of the government’s social programme through the Misiones and gave details of how these programmes were transforming the daily lives of the masses of ordinary people in the country. He also outlined the continuing land reform and the development of differing forms of workers control that were being developed in the companies that had been taken out of private hands. He also raised the prospect of the development of a different form of “direct democracy” that could bypass the traditional party representative system. This issue raises some interesting questions on whether it is possible to carry out the tasks of the revolution without the need for a political party to guide the process.

After a lively question and answer session the meeting ended with Darrall Cozens drawing together some of the threads of the discussion. He said that despite the tremendous gains that had been made and the need for trade unionists and socialists to defend those gains, the main levers of economic power still remained in the hands of the oligarchy. They will bide their time as at this moment they do not have the social base to stage a reaction. The words of Pat Robertson, the US televangelist, however, must be taken seriously. He has called for the assassination of Chavez as the only way to halt the revolution. US Imperialism and the Venezuelan oligarchy are biding their time. Unless the process of the revolution is completed there will always exist the danger of the bloodbath of the counter revolution.

The task of trade unionists and socialists in the UK was to publicise what is happening in Venezuela given the lies and distortions of the British press; build concrete links with the UNT; defend the gains of the revolution and participate in the debate that Chavez has called for on the nature of Socialism in the 21st century; affiliate to the HoV campaign; send delegates to the HoV conference on December 3rd in London and finally, when holiday plans are being discussed, give serious consideration to going to Venezuela to learn from what is happening, participate in the process and contribute to the discussion. The revolution there has brought millions of people into political life for the first time. There is a thirst for ideas, to share experiences. The fate of the revolution is not only in the hands of the masses of Venezuelans but is also in the hands of trade unionists and socialists all over the world. If we want to avoid a defeat such as in Chile in 1973, it is our duty to take part in these historical events.

After the meeting 12 copies of the ABC of the Venezuelan revolution were sold and comrades present expressed interest in the December conference. The thirst for information about Venezuela was reflected in the fact that participants had come from as far away as Aberystwyth and Blackburn to attend the meeting. Meetings like this should be held in all parts of the country to build support for the revolution.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","On Thursday November 24th, 190 members of the Leicester Revenue Network Branch PCS Union held their Autumnal General Meeting. In a two-hour meeting with a very full agenda the guest speaker was Darrall Cozens, the Midlands representative of HoV. On Thursday November 24th, 190 members of the Leicester Revenue Network Branch PCS Union held their Autumnal General Meeting. In a two-hour meeting with a very full agenda the guest speaker was Darrall Cozens, the Midlands representative of HoV. For many of the trade unionists in attendance this seemed to have been the first time that they had heard of what was happening in Venezuela. This is not surprising, as Darrall explained, given that there has been a systematic campaign in the UK media to ignore or distort the revolutionary process that is underway. Introducing the subject Darrall began with the recent demonstration in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where Chavez and Maradonna (The hand of God) addressed a demonstration of 40,000 who were protesting against the policies of neo-liberalism that Bush and US Imperialism were trying to force on the governments of Latin American countries. Some of them, such as that of Vicente Fox in Mexico, are ardent advocates of such an agreement. Yet, as Darrall pointed out, a similar pact that already exists between Canada, the USA and Mexico, had led to the creation of very large assembly plants, maquiladoras, outside Mexican cities on the US/Mexican border that had attracted young workers from all over Mexico. This herding together of young workers, devoid of family or community support, had left many young female workers very vulnerable to attack and dozens of them had been murdered and dumped in the deserts that surround the towns. This is the true meaning of neo-liberalism – families and communities destroyed, long hours on low pay in unprotected plants, as well as poverty. According to the UN some 90 million people in Latin America exist on less than $1 per day. It is against this policy that Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian movement are fighting, not only inside Venezuela but also by trying to set up an alternative trading agreement between LA countries built on mutual cooperation and mutual benefit. Within Venezuela, as Darrall explained, the oligarchy, the umbrella name for the rich and powerful, had already made three major attempts to stop Chavez – the attempted coup of April 2002, the oil lockout of December 2002/January 2003 and the recall referendum of August 2004, a right of recall guaranteed by the Bolivarian Constitution approved in 1999 by 70% of the electorate. Despite beating the opposition and winning nine electoral contests since 1998, the US still calls the Bolivarian government an “elected dictatorship”. The social base for the revolution was explained in detail as the government used oil revenues to develop social policies in health, education, food and housing through the various “misiones”. In addition land distribution, the taking over under differing forms of workers’ control of companies that had closed down or were being run inefficiently by their previous owners, had also cemented support for Hugo Chavez, who embodies the aspirations of the jobless, landless and marginalised sections of society. Some 53% of the working population work in the informal sector of the economy. In 1998, the year that Chavez was first elected, some 40% of Venezuelans lived in “critical poverty” and some 80% lived on the minimum wage or less. Between 1989 and 1995 real purchasing power had fallen by 35% and was then at the level of the mid 1950s. In 1997 some 67% of the poor lived on less than $2 per day and 33% on less than $1 per day. It was these sections of society that were benefiting most from the Bolivarian social reforms. However, as Darrall explained, the oligarchy, still in control of the main economic levers of society, was biding its time before trying to overthrow Chavez and his government. And the words of the US televangelist, Pat Robertson, where in August of this year he called for the assassination of Chavez, highlights the dangers to the revolution. The US wants rid of Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution as they have become a beacon of hope to the poor of the continent and in Venezuela itself millions of ordinary people have woken up to political life – had entered the stage of history. The question was posed to the trade unionists attending the meeting. Why should the events of a distant country in Latin America be of concern to them? As trade unionists, the gains of workers everywhere are gains for us in our fight – and defeat for others are also our defeat. When workers make gains the balance of power in the fight against capital is favourable to us. Defeat is unfavourable. We have a duty to support and defend the gains of the revolutionary process in Venezuela and become involved in the struggle taking place. How can that be done? Firstly, by organising meetings like this one to counter the lies and distortion of the capitalist media. Secondly, by building links with the UNT in a concrete manner. Next, by reading and understanding the issues involved. Then, by supporting the revolution, but not uncritically. Trade unionists and socialists have a duty to engage in fraternal discussions with our counterparts in Venezuela so that our experiences and ideas can be shared in order to ensure the success of the revolution and not to repeat the mistakes of the past, such as in Chile in September 1973. Hugo Chavez himself has called for an open and frank discussion on what is meant by socialism in the XXIst century. Chavez has stated that the capitalist road leads to hell. There is no third way between capitalism and socialism. The answer is socialism, but of what type? This is the debate we need to be involved in. Finally, trade unionists should also consider going to Venezuela on holiday to see for themselves what is happening. Despite the enthusiasm for learning more about Venezuela, as demonstrated by the questions and the discussion, the meeting was not able to affiliate to the HoV campaign, nor able to send delegates to the conference on December 3rd. These were decisions that had to be taken at a national level within the union. The PCSU branch has to be congratulated for allowing time in a busy agenda to discuss the issues of the revolution underway in Venezuela. As the meeting closed and people filed out, a bucket collection was held for the HoV and £62.50 was collected. Copies of the pamphlet “The ABC of the Venezuelan Revolution” were also sold with one member buying a copy for £5!",NA,NA

			New York: An Evening in Solidarity with Bolivarian Venezuela",2005-11-09T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Karin Jaschke, our HOV Correspondent in NY","On November 8, 2005 a remarkable event took place at New Yorks's Town Hall: An evening in solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution, so far the biggest and most important gathering of this kind. It was organized by the Alberto Lovera Bolivarian Circle of New York and the International Action Center and endorsed by prominent persons as Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky and many groups, the Hands off Venezuela Campaign among them. The importance of the event was underlined by the fact that there was a lot of media present, ranging from the New York Times to alternative media and the Latinamerican TV station Telesur. Hugo Chavez is aware that it is crucial for the Bolivarian Revolution to get support from the people of the United States, to defend Venezuela and to form a real unity of the Americas. After Hurricane Katrina, he provided relief assistance to the victims of the disaster through CITGO, the U.S. subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-owned company PDVSA. When he visited Harlem and the Bronx in September, he met with community groups and trade union leaders to explain his views of ""Socialism of the 21 st century"" that is being build in Venezuela. He offered help for U.S. schools, nursing homes, hospitals and poor communities, providing cheap home heating oil, starting with Chicago. Interviews with Hugo Chavez on ""Democracy Now!"" and ABC's ""Nightline"" with Ted Koppel enabled him to correct the picture usually drawn by U.S. media. His efforts brought him big respect in the U.S., especially among African Americans. The aim of the event at Town Hall was to foster the bonds between the U.S. and Venezuela. Many speakers from different groups showed the broad basis of the solidarity movement in winning support from the Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian and Colombian community and groups in solidarity with Cuba. Among the speakers were former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, trade unionists Chris Silvera and Roger Toussaint, Reverend Lucius Walker, who praised the ""axis of good"", and Padre Luis Barrios who called Chavez the ""prophet of socialism of the 21 st century"" and many representatives of the Bolivarian Movement in Venezuela. William Camacaro from the Bolivarian Circle Alberto Lovera emphasized the goal of forming a union with the people from the U.S. To take concrete steps in this direction, he announced that a National Solidarity Network in the U.S. would be created at the beginning of next year. Venezuela's assistance after Hurricane Katrina was highly appreciated by Curtis Mohammed of the People's Relief Fund of New Orleans, who stressed the demand of the right of return for poor Katrina survivors. A recorded message from Mumia Abu Jamal, prisoner on death row was played, who mentioned that Chavez sent oil and help to the people of New Orleans in contrast to George Bush who sent the National Guard to protect private property and who was willing to let thousands of poor black people die. Ben Dupuy and Marlene Jean Noel of Haiti refer to the parallels with Haiti, when the freely elected president Aristide was overthrown by the U.S., a precedent for what the U.S. is planning in Venezuela. The founders of www.aporrea.org , Gonzalo Gomez and Martin Sanchez, pointed out the importance of alternative and community media, that the media should be owned by the people and not by capital. Referring to the occupied factories, Martin Sanchez states that the aim of the Bolivarian Movement is not to fix capitalism but to proceed to socialism. Many speakers talked about the necessity to fight unemployment, bad working conditions, poverty and racism in the U.S. and to introduce the Solidarity Campaign to the working class and poor people in the U.S. Venezuela is the example that another world is possible and that there is an alternative. But without the people of the U.S., it is not possible to build that better world. This evening was also meant as a message to George Bush: That the American people are standing in solidarity with the Bolivarian process and would not tolerate a U.S. intervention. Miguel Hernandez of the Central University of Venezuela sent greetings from the UNT and concluded that socialism is the only way forward for Venezuela, with the means of production in the hands of the people, a process spreading across its borders to become an international revolution. At the end, Bolivarian spirit was brought to New York, when the audience started shouting together: ""Chavez, Amigo! Nueva York esta contigo!""",NA,NA

A video screening of the documentary “the revolution will not be televised” took place to give a detailed background of the 2001 coup against president Chavez, and a general overview of the current political climate in Venezuela. Afterwards, Pablo Shanchez from the Hands off Venezuela Campaign gave a short lead off, briefly filling in the gaps between the events of 2001 to the present day. In this period we have witnessed another electoral victory for Chavez, the nationalisation of many factories under workers control, and also the regrouping of the opposition as they prepare a new wave of attacks to defeat the revolution. An interesting discussion then took place where many questions were asked and comrades shared their thoughts and opinions of the future of the Bolivarian revolution and it’s relevance to those of us fighting for the socialist transformation of society in Scotland and elsewhere. It was agreed that we would meet again in November for a screening of the film “Venezuela Bolivariano” and to discuss the next stages of building the campaign in Fife and the surrounding area. The general mood of the meeting was extremely positive and afterwards everyone present signed up to become a member of the campaign, which Hugo Chavez himself has praised for it’s outstanding work internationally in fighting for solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution.",NA,NA

The keynote address will be given by Hands Off Venezuela's honorary president, John McDonnell, MP., together with fellow parliamentarian Jeremy Corbyn. McDonnell recently tabled an Early Day Motion supporting the left-wing government of Venezuela's advances in education, health and land reform, as well as the work of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, signed by over 30 Members of Parliament. The campaign has also raised the issue of solidarity within the British trade union movement. Members of Hands Off Venezuela have spoken at numerous union branch meetings, and many unions have now affiliated to the campaign, including the National Union of Journalists, the Fire Brigades Union, T&G, RMT, NATFE, CWU and Amicus. NUJ general secretary Jeremy Dear and Ruth Winters, president of the FBU, will also address the conference. In September this year Hands Off Venezuela were instrumental to the adoption of resolution 79 at the TUC in Brighton, in support of the Venezuelan government and Bolivarian Movement, which was passed unanimously. Orlando Chirino from the Venezuelan labor federation UNT, who attended the TUC conference, will be present on December 3 to give an overview of workers' struggles in Venezuela today as well as the effects of new government policies such as co-management. Hands Off Venezuela has several regional branches across Britain, including three at universities in Cambridge, Edinburgh and UEA. Also, groups from Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield and Belfast will be sending representatives to discuss and democratically decide the direction the campaign will be taking. As a highlight, veteran left-wingers Tony Benn and Hands Off Venezuela founder Alan Woods will be debating ""21st Century Socialism and the Bolivarian Revolution."" Hands Off Venezuela was set up in early 2003 to build solidarity with Venezuela's peaceful and democratic revolution.

													Hands Off Venezuela - Gothenburg","The Swedish Left Party (ex-communists) organized an international conference on Saturday 29th October where they invited different speakers from a number of solidarity organisations. Martin Lööf attended the conference as a representative of the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Sweden. Other international solidarity campaigns were also present, such as Western Sahara, Chile, Uruguay (supporters of the Frente Amplio), Palestine and Bolivia (MAS). Thirty to forty people were present at the meeting, among them some leading figures of the Left Party. In his speech, Martin gave a brief introduction to the Venezuelan revolution, its problems and strengths. Chavez’s speech was quoted where he explained that the problems of the world cannot be solved within the confines of capitalism. Martin said that he agreed with this, but he also explained that the revolution is now in a stalemate. The revolution needs to take on a socialist character and the current state must be replaced with trustworthy representatives of the masses. The opportunists and the careerists within the Bolivarian leadership must replaced with leaders elected by the rank and file members. In his speech an appeal was made to the party to send a representative on the EU delegation that will observe the December 4 th presidential elections. The point was made that the rightwing PP party in Spain is mobilising and that the right-wingers need to be balanced by leftwing observers. Next year the Left Party will be holding a congress in Gothenburg, and a suggestion was made that a representative from the UNT or some other Venezuelan organisation should be invited to the congress. There was an exchange of words between the representatives of the MAS and the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The speaker from the MAS started to talk about how ""sectarian Trotskyists"" criticised them for being reformist. He argued: “This is not the 1960s or 1970s, we are living in a new period with new movements, we can no longer talk about the dictatorship of the proletariat or that the working class will have the leading role in a revolution. Bolivia is not Sweden with an industrial history.” Probably referring to socialism he said that “we need utopias” so we can realize them in the future! In replying to this the Hands Off Venezuela representative gave the example of Luis (“Lucio”) Gutierrez, former president of Ecuador. He became president on the basis of a popular revolt and was brought down by another popular revolt because he revealed himself as being no better than the previous president. This will happen with all leaders who fail to live up to the demands of the people. In Latin America people are fighting desperately for a change now and not in some distant future. At the end of the meeting there was an exchange of email addresses and a promise of an invitation for HOV to speak at a local party branch. 30 Oct 2005",NA,NA

Having little idea of what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised by the response. Initially we faced the usual barrier of NUS bureaucracy, forcing us to move from the grass outside the union to outside the gate. Despite this we received a very positive response from the students. There seemed to be a widespread support for the ideals of solidarity forwarded by the HOV campaign and empathy for the Bolivarian Revolution. Literature was also sold at a good rate; the number of ABC’s of the Venezuelan Revolution unsold quickly diminishing. The two copies of Che Guevara’s Motorcycle Diaries were also eagerly bought, a reflection of the double-edged popularisation of Che Guevara’s adventures, as works of greater theoretical importance went unsold. We were also able to get quite a few contact details and had a number of good discussions with interested students. Possibly the most positive development was the eager support offered by a particular officer of the NUS. Hopefully we will be able to capitalise on the two day’s events. We can best hope to consolidate our activity by forming a society and by having a video screening later this year.",NA,NA

													Daniel Morley","On Monday 10 th October Hands Off Venezuela, together with activists and students at the University of East Anglia, jointly held a video showing of Venezuela Bolivariana . Jorge Martin and Hazel Marsh, a lecturer at University of East Anglia and expert on Latin America, were present, in an attempt to promote awareness and solidarity with our cause and set up a Hands Off Venezuela society in campus. Last week we reported about the HOV stall at the fresher’s fair, where we received 35 signatures of people who were interested, and we had anticipated up to 50 people coming to the showing of Venezuela Bolivariana on 10 th October. In the week leading up to the event posters promoting it were put up around campus to heighten awareness, and Hazel did great work in sending round emails to all of her students and linking the event to anything and anyone involved in Spanish or Latin American studies. As a result, 160 people came to the viewing and talk by Jorge Martin and participated in a lively question and answer session. Needless to say, there were a few dissenters in the audience, one of whom was a Venezuelan who insisted the film was propaganda sanctioned by Chavez, against all evidence, while another insisted Chavez has supernatural séances with Bolivar (although he later admitted this was just hearsay in certain sections of Latin American society!). However, their questions were answered resoundingly by Jorge, and the general mood and attitude of the audience was extremely positive and participatory. After the questions and answers were resolved there was a brief book sale with more personal questions on Venezuela. Again this was very positive and encouraging, with many people expressing their desire to help in the society and some even inquired on whether they could be part of the delegation to Caracas for the World Social Forum in January, not something you expect from 19 year old students in the middle of a degree! We have arranged for a social on Monday 17 th October for all the activists to meet each other and discuss the future of the group and formulate ideas for events. We are also planning to show The Revolution Will Not Be Televised to students in the near future. Monday should also be the day we acquire status as an official UEA students society, allowing us access to a grant of roughly £300-400. At the moment the group is in its very earliest stages of infancy and there is much to be resolved and made concrete, but all the signs are that UEA will provide Hands Off Venezuela with an excellent platform for extending solidarity towards the Venezuelan people and their revolution.

By the end of the day we had received 35, which was as many as a great deal of established societies and is a very good start at such a small university. We are also expecting many more people to come to the showing of Venezuela Bolivariana and the talk from Jorge Martin on October 10, as posters advertising the event are to be displayed in Norwich city centre and UEA, ensuring that awareness is not raised and limited towards only the small collection of UEA freshers that happened to notice the HOV stall. This will also hopefully help introduce people from all over Norfolk to our campaign and the truth about Venezuela, and with good hard work could lead to the setting up of a Norfolk branch of HOV. Prior to this, a university lecturer, who has spent a month in Venezuela studying the situation, and many years in various other Latin American nations, contacted HOV in London about arranging to show Venezuela Bolivariana at the university to raise awareness. Hopefully with her help, good knowledge of the university and experience of showing films at UEA on Latin American (which regularly attracted audiences of 50 plus) last year, a vibrant branch can be established in Norwich.",NA,NA

According to the official story, he spread the benefits of civilisation across the continent; in reality, his arrival heralded a new age of terror and genocide which took the lives of over 100 million native Americans. All this has been erased from popular consciousness, but in Venezuela the schools are now finally teaching the truth about this mass-murderer.

Richard Gott, long-time leading journalistic authority on Latin America, will be signing copies of his new book on Chávez, with Venezuelan food and music later on.

The meeting took place on the same day as LP veteran and refugee from Nazi Germany, 82 year old Walter Wolfgang, had been expelled from the Conference under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, for the heinous crime of shouting ""nonsense"" when Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was talking about the war in Iraq. “New Labour has descended from Clause 4 to Group 4,” commented Alan Simpson MP. Wolfgang received a warm welcome to the rally and was the first of a long list of speakers, trade union leaders, left-wing MPs and activists, all united by their opposition to the right wing policies of the New Labour government. Amongst them were Jeremy Corbyn MP, Bob Crow (RMT), Gerry Doherty (TSSA), Billy Hayes (CWU), Alice Mahon, John McDonnell MP, Michael Meacher MP, Linda Riordan MP, Mark Serwotka (PCS) and Alan Simpson MP. Hands Off Venezuela was present at the rally with a stall and Jorge Martin, the campaign's international secretary, spoke from the platform. John McDonnell MP, chair of the LRC and president of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign who was chairing the meeting, introduced him by reminding the audience about the internationalist character of the labour movement. Jorge started by saying that events in Venezuela should be a source of excitement and inspiration for socialists around the world. Even in the last few days, he pointed out, a number of factories and landed states had been expropriated. He also described Chavez's speech at the United Nations, where he said the UN did not work, and could not be reformed. Amongst other things, Jorge Martin explained the enormous achievements of Venezuela's Bolivarian government, particularly in the fields of education, health care and land reform. He then stressed that one of the most important things happening in Venezuela right now is the debate about socialism, which was launched by Chavez himself earlier this year. The debate is now permeating all sections of Venezuelan society and particularly the trade union movement, where workers are experimenting with different forms of workers’ participation in the running of industry. The fact that an elected head of state, who is at the same time the leader of a mass revolutionary movement, has raised clearly that the choice we are facing is one of socialism or barbarism, was of enormous significance for socialists all over the world.",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela Vancouver","Vancouver’s Latin American and Venezuelan solidarity groups managed to pull off a series of very successful meetings and events for two Venezuelan visitors who, at the last moment, decided to take a “side trip” to Vancouver during their Toronto/Montreal speaking tour. Vancouver’s Latin American and Venezuelan solidarity groups managed to pull off a series of very successful meetings and events for two Venezuelan visitors who, at the last moment, decided to take a “side trip” to Vancouver during their Toronto/Montreal speaking tour. More than one hundred people turned up at the Maritime Labour Centre to hear Jacobo Torres de Leon and Marlyn Zerpa speak at the main public forum on Thursday, September 22 nd . Many groups came together to host the event, including the Vancouver Internationalist Bolivarian Circle “Bob Everton”, Hands Off Venezuela, La Surda, the FMLN, Haiti Solidarity BC, the Vancouver and District Labour Council, and others. All of these groups have an understanding of the importance of the Bolivarian revolution, as a beacon of hope and inspiration for working people and the poor not just in Latin America, but worldwide. Jacobo Torres, who is a UNT organizer, gave an enthralling account of the revolutionary process, beginning with the 1989 IMF package which led to the popular uprising known as the caracazo . Jacobo impressed the audience by admitting that he and Marlyn had been somewhat surprised to find that there is also poverty in Canada and that the struggles of the Canadian working class are the same as those of Venezuelan workers and poor – struggles against privatization and for quality healthcare and education. Marlyn outlined the incredible gains of the various misiones that are providing healthcare and literacy, primary and secondary education in the communities. Both speakers took an internationalist approach, emphasizing the Venezuelan revolution as just one part of a pan-American and worldwide revolution against the common oppressor – the transnational corporations and their system of capitalism, which puts profit before people. The speakers’ presentations were followed by a very high level of discussion, with Jacobo and Marlyn answering questions about everything from the new rights guaranteed for Venezuela’s indigenous peoples to international free trade agreements to Haiti solidarity. Jacobo is also a member of the International Planning Council of the World Social Forum which is taking place in Caracas between January 24 th and 29 th . He emphasized the need for North Americans to attend the forum – even those who are undecided or not supportive of the revolution – to see the process first-hand and engage in discussion.

			Hands Off Venezuela brings a message of revolution to anti-war protest",2005-09-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Rodrigo Trompiz","Following the “Bring the Troops Home” march in central London on September 24, over 60 people crammed into the function room of the Carpenters Arms pub, near Hyde Park, for a public meeting called by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The march had been heavily leafleted by HOV campaigners, and people from all walks of life and political backgrounds had arrived, eager to hear about the exciting process taking place in Venezuela. The meeting was chaired by HOV's Espe Espigares, who began by explaining that the campaign was founded in a response to the right-wing coup in April 2002, and whose main role was to combat disinformation spread by the mass media and to forge links with trade unions and other groups within Venezuela. The main speaker was Jorge Martín, international secretary of the campaign. He began with the exciting news that the TUC had just passed a motion expressing solidarity with the process in Venezuela, even though the motion had been watered down, with the word “revolution” removed. Still, this is great news for the campaign, and a credit to the hard work of campaigners, as the TUC represents some 6.7 million workers, and is the first European trade union confederation to pass such a resolution. Jorge then talked about President Hugo Chávez's recent explosive appearance at the UN. Chávez did not beat around the bush, so to speak – he began by saying that the UN had been in terminal decline for 60 years, i.e. since its founding! He also argued that it cannot be reformed, and needs a revolution within it. Extremely radical ideas, especially for the UN, where meaningless diplomatic statements are the norm. Chávez also called for the veto power to be scrapped, for countries of the South to be incorporated, and for the organisation not be based in the country which has violated far more UN resolutions than any other – the United States. Jorge pointed out how the speech shows the way in which Venezuela has become a point of reference in the anti-imperialist struggle. Chávez also visited poor communities in the South Bronx, where he gave a speech saying that capitalism is not working and that we must fight for socialism – not the kind of thing we in the West are used to hearing from our 'leaders'! The Venezuelan president stressed once again that the conflict is not with the US people, but with the Bush administration. Jorge then spoke of the “revolution within the revolution”- the Zamora decrees speeding up land reform, the increased rate of expropriation, as well as the nationalisation under worker control of companies such as Venepal, and the recent seizure of the Heinz tomato processing plant. Another important topic raised was the threat to the revolution from within – the reformist bureaucrats on one side against the revolutionaries on the other. Chávez himself is clearly with the revolutionaries, having stated time and time again that the problems of capitalism cannot be solved within capitalism. There then followed a series of questions and comments from the audience, on topics such as the misiones, co-operatives and armed forces, demonstrating once more how taken people are with the process in Venezuela and how keen they are to spread the message and to get involved. There were many new faces in the audience, and almost all expressed a desire to learn more about Venezuela and to work with the campaign. Jorge wrapped up the meeting by reiterating the importance of spreading information and forging links, as this struggle is not just within Venezuela – the struggle taking place across the continent of Latin America, and across the entire world.",NA,NA

													Rodrigo Trompiz","The great thing about the Festival of Students and Youth is the opportunity to meet young people on the left from all over the world. From the perspective of the Hands off Venezuela campaign, the most interesting aspect is listening to the delegates' view of the process in Venezuela. Some, particularly from Europe, came to Venezuela with limited knowledge of the Bolivarian revolution, or worse, misinformation from the mainstream media. It is gratifying to see how impressed they are, not only with the obvious achievements such as the missions, but with the level of political consciousness amongst workers and the poor, as well and the democratic and revolutionary nature of the new UNT union, and the contrast with unions in their own countries. People I have spoken to were also incredibly impressed by how involved people are in the political process, and how much control they have of their own lives - what real democracy means, of course. What this means, we as a campaign would hope, is that the delegates (and I cannot offhand think of any countries not represented here) will not only provide more solidarity with Venezuela in future but will also take what they have learned from the revolutionary process here back to their own countries and, inspired by what they have experienced, build similar democractic, revolutionary movements of their own. From workshops on the Miami 5 to talks on the uprisings in Bolivia, the one constant theme is how the Bolivarian Revolution is a shining light for Latin America and the rest of the world. The opportuntity for Bolivar's dream of a united Latin America to be realised has never been greater.",NA,NA

			Venezuela: Eyewitness report from the heart of the revolution",2005-09-07T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ramon Samblas","One hundred and sixty years ago, Ezequiel Zamora – a Venezuelan revolutionary peasant influenced by the ideas of the French revolution and utopian socialism - also known as the General of the Sovereign People, led crowds of peasants who were fighting for land reform, freedom and democracy. In his flag everybody could read “Horror to the Oligarchy”. For the past six years the Venezuelan masses have been involved in a process that is filling the oligarchy and their imperialist allies in the US with horror- the Bolivarian revolution. Since the beginning of 2005 there has been a growing interest in this movement initially inspired by the ideas of the father of Venezuela’s independence Simon Bolivar. Hugo Chavez’s comments praising socialism as the way forward for Venezuela’s revolution triggered the wave of interest in this Latin American country and its revolution, often dismissed by wide layers on the left. On the other hand the heroic struggle of the Venezuelan masses to have control over their own affairs, has caught the imagination of many students, trade unionists and activists on the left, all over the world. This summer up to 17,000 young internationalists from 144 countries gathered in Caracas for one week. The reason was to attend the World Festival of Youth and Students, but the majority of delegates decided to take advantage of this festival to find out what is really going on in Venezuela. In order to understand the current situation within the Venezuelan revolution we must go back one year. On August 15, 2004, 70% of Venezuelans turned out in the recall referendum to decide on whether President Chavez should stay or go. Many realised that the success or the defeat of that referendum was going to have important consequences beyond the position of Chavez himself. Since then there have been other successes on the electoral, social and economic fronts. Just 45 days after the recall referendum, on October 31, the so-called “democratic opposition” managed to hold on to just two Federal states. These were blows that the social base of the opposition could not cope with and they became completely demoralised. Most of them decided to pack up and go back home hoping that things might get better for them some day in the future. Gradually, the attention of the masses moved away from the external enemy or “the beast” (US imperialism and the reactionary Venezuelan ruling class) to the Bolivarian movement itself. Since then, the movement has been going forward, but even more significantly, the left or revolutionary sectors within the Bolivarian movement have been strengthened. There have been developments, such as the debate on socialism sparked off by Chavez’s comments at the World Social Forum, the nationalisation of two companies, the introduction of “co-gestion” or co-management in companies such as ALCASA, INVEVAL, INVEPAL amongst others and the calls of Hugo Chavez to fight corruption, which have pushed the movement to the left. This does not mean that imperialism has been defeated. They are getting ready to crush the Venezuelan revolution at the first opportunity, but so far they have proven incapable of mobilising on the streets. This is why the imperialists and their allies in Venezuela are looking for diplomatic provocations to stir up problems from outside. The latest example of this was the terrorist statements of Pat Robertson on a fundamentalist TV channel. Before this incident, we had the diplomatic clash over the DEA. Hugo Chavez accused this body of doing nothing about the drugs problem, and of being a cover for intelligence gathering operations against Venezuela on the part of the Bush Administration. Aporrea.org reported at the end of August that diplomatic immunity had been removed from DEA civil servants operating in Venezuela. The feelings and beliefs of the Venezuelan people about the current situation are generally optimistic, but obviously the answers I got from the people I spoke to were varied. Those people that are not very involved in the revolution but have allegiance to Chavez and the movement tend to think that the situation is very stable. They are happy that there are no troubles or riots on the streets - like before the recall referendum - and they are quite happy that Hugo Chavez is going to stay in office for some time. Those activists and people who are heavily involved in the revolution and stand on the left of the process, have somewhat different views. They can see problems emanating from the bureaucracy. Although they are aware of this and they are determined to fight, they do not have a clear idea of how to do this. They are absolutely critical about the situation. There are wide layers of the population that are very critical about the people that work with the president. While Hugo Chavez enjoys full support from the masses, activists and local leaderships, the people he works with do not enjoy this level of support. Some of them are even hated by the movement, like Barreto and Bernal (the two mayors of Caracas) who have been really discredited since they took the Mayors’ office. The distrust of the ranks of movement towards the leading individuals that are positioned between Chavez and the rank and file is clear. The recent local elections that took place on August 8 exposed this fact. The MVR (Chavez’s party) used the slogan “true Chavistas” while their local candidates sought to get a picture of themselves with the President. This desperate attempt to portray all candidates as being fully supported by Hugo Chavez did not avoid an abstention rate of 68%. We cannot say that all these abstentions can be explained by the boycott campaign launched by the opposition parties, because in true Chavista areas the abstention rate only reached 45% to 50%. As a resident of one of the popular neighbourhoods “23 de Enero” told me, “had Chavez been put forward as a candidate in the local elections instead of these unknown people, we would have had the Venezuelans queuing up outside the polling booths just like on August 15.” In spite of all this, in these elections the parties that support the revolution won 80% of the council seats. Of this total 58% were won by the MVR. These elections also indicated other changes in the mood of Venezuelan society. Gregory Wilpert from venezuelanalysis pointed out the following: “An examination of some of the city council elections shows that there was a trend towards class polarization, so that in middle to upper class Caracas neighborhoods such as Chacao and Baruta, where Chavistas lost seats to the opposition and in poorer Caracas neighborhoods, such as Sucre and Libertador Chavistas gained seats.” The reason for this could be that the last elections took place in 2000. Then, social and political polarisation was not as sharp as it is now in Venezuela, and even some bourgeois sectors supported the Chavez government. Bureaucracy and corruption are big issues in Venezuela. It is very significant that President Chavez himself has taken a clear stand against bureaucracy. This echoes the pressure he is feeling from below, but at the same time his statements against bureaucracy boost the confidence of the masses who are strengthened in their resolve to implement this struggle. Recently, the Ministry of Information published Che Guevara’s pamphlet “Against Bureaucracy” and also calendars, posters and other material advocating Socialism and fighting bureaucracy. Cases of bureaucracy have been in the limelight of Venezuelan politics recently. Chavez himself criticised his own Housing Minister on national TV because he had not even reached 50% of the target for public housing. To be precise, only 43,000 homes out of the target of 120,000 have been built. Official figures would indicate that 2.8 billion dollars have been spent, and everyone in Venezuela is wondering where all this money has gone. The nurses who are part of the ‘Barrio Adentro’ programme also came into conflict with the bureaucracy. The Minister of Health ended his term in office after Hugo Chavez himself sacked him. When it was discovered that he had withheld payments to the nurses and on top of that he accused them of being “escualidos”, the president did not hesitate to kick him out. At the end of the day, this amazing level of corruption that this layer of bureaucrats is involved in is the direct result of the hesitations on the part of the leadership of the Bolivarian revolution to smash the capitalist state apparatus and replace it with the true government of the working people. Leon Trotsky in his article “Against bureaucracy, progressive and unprogressive” published in “Problems of Everyday Life” says the following: “No government, even the most active and enterprising, can possibly transform life without the broadest initiative of the masses. The state can organise conditions of life down to the last cell of the community, the family, but unless these cells combine their own choice and will into a commonwealth no serious and radical changes can possibly be achieved in Economic conditions and Home life.” Even though Leon Trotsky was referring to a state that had already destroyed capitalism (Russia after the 1917 revolution), these words really do apply to the day-to-day reality of Venezuela. The amazing level of participation of the masses has been the key to keeping the revolution alive and to consolidating it. It has been thanks to the organised communities that the social programmes have been successful. No one can imagine that healthcare programmes such as the ‘Barrio Adentro’ (Into the Neighbourhood) would have been possible without the thousands of volunteers that opened up the shantytowns for the volunteer doctors. Clearly, what this rightwing bureaucratic clique - that has its fingers in all the ministries - is aiming at is to eliminate the participation of the masses from the process. They see this as a way of keeping the movement under their own control and thus making it wither away. But this is going to be a difficult task. One of the features of this revolution is the huge scale of participation of the masses in the tasks of everyday life. There are thousands of examples and facts to illustrate this. For instance, Olga Marina is a 70-year-old grandmother who I met in La Pastora, Caracas. In spite of her age, she was part of a “healthcare committee” which organised the distribution of food and managed refurbishment works in her neighbours’ houses. Another example is the Bolivarian Taxi Drivers’ Force. One night, we hired what looked like the scruffiest cab in Caracas. After a few minutes, an Italian comrade and I dared to ask the taxi driver about his opinions on the process. He gave us a full report of the 900-driver strong organisation and how on the day of the local elections they had organised patrols of taxi drivers to go to the areas and give free lifts to the people who wished to go to the polling stations, as a way of breaking the abstention campaign launched by the so-called “democratic opposition”. He also told us that the couriers are organised in similar fashion. These are not isolated cases, at all. Another thing we found in different working class areas of Caracas and in the State of Miranda was that everybody was very willing to say how the process had improved their lives in a dramatic way. We could fill books with the explanations we got about people’s medical operations in Cuba. It is very clear that the revolution has improved people’s lives in a very concrete manner. A very striking feature of this revolution is that it has given pride back to the downtrodden. People in the working class “barrios” of Caracas have painted their houses with very bright colours in a show of optimism and pride. They refer to Venezuela as “our country”, but not in a chauvinistic way. The meaning they were giving to this was that now Venezuela belongs to everybody and not to the elite that has historically ruled the country. People also has a very internationalist sense of the revolution. More than once I would hear people saying, “As comandante Chavez says, this revolution does not belong to the Venezuelans anymore, this revolution belongs to the Latin American and the peoples of the world.” Although the structures of the Venezuelan state remain capitalist, this does not mean that within it there is not a ferocious struggle taking place between revolutionaries and sectors that think that the revolution has gone too far. There is a huge division between the reformists and revolutionaries within the Miraflores palace, the ministries and all kinds of public offices. In some ministries, the left is strong like for instance in the Ministry of Labour. Cristina Iglesias is actually working shoulder to shoulder with the UNT in order to tackle the anti-worker practices of the bosses, trying to boost the participation of workers in trade unions and trying to take further the co-management measures. However, all of this is not free from attempts at internal boycott. Sometimes because of this division and internal fighting things are really slow and are not getting done. The delegates of the World Festival of the Youth saw the practical results of this situation. Transport was never on time, buses with delegates were stopped two and three times to be checked by different bodies (National Guard, Miranda State police and the organisers of the festival). International guests had their invitations and plane tickets cancelled with no reason whatsoever or simply never received them. In spite of this, it is clear that the fact that the state apparatus is in the middle of a revolution is not all negative. The Army and National Guard rank and file troops mix with the crowds of civilians and they are no longer seen as their enemies but as their brothers. It is a really amazing to see a young soldier carrying a submachine gun in one hand and at the same time reading with a lot of interest a revolutionary leaflet. Another example is the second state TV channel – Vive TV. I was invited to speak at this TV channel together with another comrade of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and a female activist from the “23 de Enero” neighbourhood in Caracas. When we entered the building of the TV station we were really surprised to see that no one was wearing a suit. Everybody looked very young, and revolutionary posters featuring Che Guevara, the fight against bureaucracy and solidarity with the Iraqi resistance were everywhere. We were praised by Thierry, the vice-chairperson of the channel because of the report we gave on air about the solidarity work with Venezuela we are doing in Britain. It was even more revealing when the female activist told the vice-chairperson of Vive TV that “there are not enough programmes that go into women’s problems”. Thierry agreed with her and replied, “Yes, that is true. You should come more often onto our TV programmes, because we need to highlight the situation of those women that live in working class communities. I am not very keen on these female intellectuals that have studied an MA or a PhD in Sociology in Canada, but do not have a clue about the situation of women in the working class communities.” Later on a French cameraman that works for Vive TV told us that most of them used to work in alternative and community media outlets. However, the situation cannot remain like this forever on capitalist basis. Sooner or later, the situation has to be resolved, in one way or another. The capitalist apparatus of the state is working against the revolution. Since Hugo Chavez opened up the debate on socialism, it has become very easy in Venezuela to raise Marxism in discussions with Bolivarian activists. The very fact that this debate is taking place indicates how the movement is maturing and how the masses are learning from their own experience –sometimes, a bitter experience. “An ounce of action is worth a tone of theory,” Lenin used to say. The “necessity to transcend capitalism, […] but through socialism, true socialism,” as Hugo Chavez put it for the first time at the beginning of this year, has connected very easily with the experience of the Venezuelan masses. Socialism has affected the Venezuelan revolution in a very dramatic way. There are murals, t-shirts, slogans, posters, graffiti… that express this will of the people to move towards socialism. It was very significant that during the parade that opened the World Festival of the Youth and the Students, an entertainer welcomed the different delegations to the “Socialist Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela”. However, this debate is facing the same problems as the one on “the revolution within the revolution”. The rightwing is trying to appropriate this new concept (socialism in this case) and is aiming to remove the real content of this word. I had the opportunity to attend the debate on “The Bolivarian revolution and Socialism of the 21 st century” and it was really annoying to see a CPV bureaucrat just mouthing in parrot fashion the words, phrases and expressions that Hugo Chavez had used in one of his speeches not long before, but without any life in these words. Then there are others that just try to marry this concept to the existence of the market economy and private property. What I have seen and experienced in Venezuela has reasserted my beliefs on the key role that the Venezuelan revolution will play in the overthrow of capitalism in Latin America. The Venezuelan revolution is taking place in a context where revolution is at the top of the agenda of the Latin American masses. The social unrest that has recently taken place in Ecuador and Bolivia altogether with the Cuban revolution that has resisted imperialist harassment for more than 45 years indicate that there are good prospects for the Venezuelan revolution. However, the Venezuelan revolution is not free from threats. Enemies inside and outside the country, as well as in and outside the movement, threaten the Venezuelan revolution. In Venezuela the concrete carrying out of socialism is an unaccomplished task facing the movement. Internationally, the trade unions, the students and everybody standing on the left should build solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign has been already doing a serious and effective work on this front.",NA,NA

													Greg Oxley","A series of very successful meetings were held in solidarity with the revolution in Venezuela at the annual Communist Party festival — la Fête de l’Humanité — which was held in the Paris area last weekend. In France, Hands Off Venezuela (HOV) is led and organised by the supporters of the Marxist paper and website La Riposte , who have been waging an energetic campaign in support of the Venezuelan revolution over a number of years. The international secretary of the campaign, Jorge Martin, spoke at three separate meetings on Saturday 10 th September. The first of these took place at 12.30. Marie-Antoinette Borjas, of the Venezuelan Embassy in Paris, had invited Jorge to speak at the meeting organised by the Embassy in order to explain the significance of the revolutionary events unfolding in Venezuela. More than 60 people attended this meeting. Jorge opened his speech by comparing the attitude of the Venezuelan government to that of the Bush administration in relation to the humanitarian disaster in New Orleans. He explained the reforms being carried out by the Chavez government, and retraced the history of the Venezuelan revolution, emphasising the way in which the big capitalists and landowners, supported by US imperialism, had consistently tried to overthrow the government and sabotage the reforms. This explains the socialist and revolutionary conclusions being drawn by Hugo Chavez and by the workers and youth of Venezuela, he said, and why the revolution was now moving in the direction of the overthrow of capitalism. Nonetheless, he also warned that the revolution is still in danger, as is Chavez personally. Jorge was warmly applauded. Marie-Antoinette Borjas, speaking on behalf of the Embassy thanked Jorge for his speech, and was clearly very enthusiastic about the work being carried out in France and internationally by the HOV campaign. The second meeting was held in the stall of the Ardèche federation of the French Communist Party. François Jacquart, the Federal Secretary, gave a brief introductory speech, in which he underlined the importance of learning the lessons of the events in Venezuela. The 85 people who crowded into the stall to hear Jorge were extremely attentive and enthusiastic. They applauded at great length, and queued up at the end of the meeting to buy copies of La Riposte and the latest pamphlets produced by the organisation on Venezuela and on Cuba. Finally, in the evening, Jorge spoke to an impressive gathering of no less than 250 people in the main meeting hall of the “Village du Monde” (the international area of the Fête de l’Humanité ). Jorge’s speech was interrupted more than once by applause and cheering. Towards the end of his speech, he spoke of the necessity of building the forces in all countries, and especially in France, in order to spread the revolutionary ideas of Marxism and work towards the overthrow of capitalism internationally. This last meeting was jointly organised by La Riposte and the association Forum pour un Autre Monde, led by André Meyer. André made a decisive contribution to the success of this meeting. His association sent out some 1500 invitations, and distributed a considerable number of leaflets at the festival. Without his support, this memorable event would never have taken place. Before Jorge began his speech, André explained the importance of the solidarity work being carried out by the Forum pour un Autre Monde, and also emphasised the work of the Marxist organisation La Riposte . Marie-Antoinette Borjas was on the platform alongside André Meyer and Jorge Martin. She made a short but very moving speech, giving concrete examples of how the social reforms of the Chavez government were changing the lives of ordinary working people, and particularly of the most oppressed sections of society. Overall, more than 400 people heard Jorge speak at the Fête de l’Humanité. All three meetings were organised with the support of the Bolivarian Circles of Paris and Toulouse. In the last meeting, Daniel Yegrès, on behalf of the Bolivarian Circle in Paris, made a characteristically militant and enthusiastic speech. For my part, and on behalf of all the comrades of La Riposte , I would like to extend our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to André Meyer, for his unfailing support in the preparation of this meeting, and of course to Marie-Antoinette Borgas.

													Vanessa Carolina del Valle Marcano - Vheadline.com","ABN reports: Over 120,000 youngsters from 133 countries are expected to be present at the XVI World Youth and Students Festival to take place in Venezuela from August 9-15. During his weekly Alo Presidente #229, President Hugo Chavez said that around 458 youth and student organizations will be coming to Caracas to discuss issues pertinent to the present and the future of nations. At least 11,000 delegates from the Americas will be present at the festival in order to debate issues related to the destruction of the environment, neo-liberal policies and their consequences, solidarity and support for suffering nations, aggression by part of US imperialism, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and its colonialist pretenses, as well as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) and its integrationist purpose. In addition, on August 13 and 14, the Anti Imperialist Tribunal is expected to meet, holding four debate sessions on denounces made by people against imperialism, as well as denounces against embargo, threats, aggressions, capitalist exploitation as a system of oppression and solutions to these problems. During the festival there will be different solidarity days for each continent. A concert for peace will take place on August 14, to honor the people who came together and defeated Nazism and Fascism during World War II. The closing events will be dedicated completely to the Venezuelan people, commemorating the bicentennial anniversary of Simon Bolivar’s Swearing on the Sacred Mount, as well as the Venezuelan people’s triumph in the August 15, 2004 presidential referendum.",NA,NA

			16th World Festival of Students and Youth &#8211; Chavez once again calls for socialism as the only way to",2005-08-10T00:00:00Z,NA,"Yesterday, August 8 saw the start of the 16th World Festival of Students and Youth, which is being held in Caracas this year. Under the slogan ""For peace, solidarity and against imperialism"", more than 15,000 young people from all over the globe gathered to discuss an entire range of issues, all of them anti-imperialist in nature. Very much to its credit, the Venezuelan government is sponsoring this important event and opened up the Military Academy, Fuerte Tiuna to receive the delegates for the official opening rally. Delegates from an impressive 144 different countries from all continents lined up for the opening rally. The Cuban delegation was among the biggest with 1,800 youth present. There were 2,200 delegates from Colombia and the Venezuelan delegation was composed of more than 3,000 delegates. The attendants of the ceremony were surprised and glad that there were 720 delegates present from the United States. The delegates were greeted by the slogan “Welcome to the Socialist Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela”. After all the delegations had paraded in front of President Chavez there were performances of indigenous culture. Representatives of the Guaranis and other indigenous Venezuelan peoples presented Hugo Chavez with different items that represented their cultures. Equally impressive was the team of volunteers who welcomed the visitors. Apart from the translation teams, the food catering teams and the National Guard, a sizeable section of the Bolivarian youth joined the march, singing songs, shouting revolutionary slogans and performing dances. At the end of the parade, when all delegations had finally marched to the main square and after the performances, President Chavez officially opened the Festival. After a long wait, Chavez addressed the thousands of youth (as well as the not so young people who were also present) who listened eagerly to what he had to say. He started by looking back sixty years to when the atom bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. President Chavez paid tribute to the victims of this genocide and condemned these acts of terrorism. “Today,” he said, “there is an atomic bomb of youth in the valley of Caracas.” They had come to see Caracas, the place where Simon Bolivar was born and were very much welcome at this Festival. This has been a great challenge for Venezuela and more than two years of preparation were invested in this event, involving a lot of coordination, and requiring plenty of logistical and political support. Chavez then recalled the main events of the last six decades. At the end of the 1940s there was the Chinese revolution, one of the greatest events in human history. This great event was followed by the Cuban Revolution a decade later. Chavez described it as a tremendous inspiration for all of Latin America. This great event marked the path for the future, the President affirmed. In the 1960s American imperialism suffered a humiliating defeat in Vietnam, which proved that the Empire was not invincible. “A people that wants to be free cannot be defeated”, he said, praising the heroic Vietnamese resistance against imperialism. The 1970s were a period of hope in Latin America, where we saw the Chile of Allende, which was unfortunately brutally crushed by US imperialism. The end of the 1980s in turn signified a universal earthquake with the fall of the Soviet Union. The old political equilibrium was destroyed and after the fall of the socialist camp, the capitalists declared the “end of history”. “Neo-liberal globalisation,” Chavez said, “is no more than another word for imperialism, and imperialism,” he continued, “is the highest stage of capitalism, as Lenin said”. In the 1990s the word capitalism had disappeared from dictionaries and a moral and ideological crisis set in, creating a period of intense doubt and confusion. However, like a phoenix rising from its ashes, the President explained that the fighters and revolutionaries would reappear and that they were in fact reappearing. “We are starting a new process, a new dawn where the ideas of justice, peace and equality will be central.” Chavez claimed he was profoundly convinced that the last years had been very demanding and difficult. However, despite the great frustration, in the first decade of the 21st century, thousands of youth are gathering in Caracas. This, Chavez proclaimed, points to more than simply a new sense of hope. It is an opportunity to debate and to open the battle for ideas. For his part, Chavez does not believe in a struggle in one isolated country. As he said at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre at the end of last year, Chavez again stated that socialism was the only true path and the only way to build a new world. “It is our duty and our challenge to save our planet from the most powerful imperialism that has ever existed, i.e. US imperialism.” Significantly, Chavez did not see all American people as one reactionary mass. On the contrary, he firmly saluted and congratulated the American delegation present in Caracas and recognized the “great fighters of the American people”, mentioning the name of Martin Luther King. In a bold but very true statement, he said, “The future of the world depends on the consciousness of the American people. When they unite, they can save the world from war and destruction.” Chavez then went on to explain that this was in fact the best moment for the Festival to be held, in these terrible conditions under capitalism and despite the existence of most powerful and hypocritical form of imperialism in history. “The Roman Empire,” he said, “was at least not as hypocritical, since they called themselves an Empire. American imperialism, on the other hand, shamefully proclaims to ‘fight for democracy’”, after which he gave the examples of the role of the US in Chile, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama and Haiti to prove the opposite. “The whole of America has suffered the attacks of US imperialism. Bolivar was right when he said in 1826, ‘The United States of America seems destined by providence to plague America with misery in the name of Liberty.’” Then he turned the audience’s attention to Venezuela, “where US imperialism has suffered some nasty surprises”. US imperialism is not invincible, a fact which has not only been proven in Venezuela, but also in Cuba, where the revolutionary people have struggled against US imperialism for 40 years. Chavez greeted Fidel Castro, who was watching his speech that was also broadcasted on all Venezuelan TV channels. “We came here to debate about peace. But to the hawks in the Pentagon we say, ‘If someday you get the crazy idea of coming to invade us, we'll make you bite the dust defending the freedom of our land,’” after which the crowd loudly started shouting “el pueblo armado, jamás será aplastado” (The armed people, will never be smashed). “The struggle of Venezuela is the struggle of the people of the whole world”, proclaimed Chavez as he began to sum up his inspiring speech. He recalled the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, who in the 1960s on his visit to Cuba wrote, “Conditions and circumstances impose upon us a revolution.” He called for a moral revolution to save the world and for a “revolutionary humanism”. But he also added that this was not enough. A political revolution was needed – a political revolution through democracy. Not the false democracy but real people’s democracy, like in Venezuela. “Thus,” he said, “we need a moral, social, political and economical revolution in order to destroy the perverse mechanism of this capitalist system.” By way of conclusion, repeating what he had said earlier in his speech, Chavez proclaimed: “I have said this earlier. I am convinced more than ever, and I will retain this belief until I die, that the only path to destroy capitalism is socialism. It is the only way to save the planet and the new generations.” To this a pedantic would have only a few commas to add. Some references to Jesus Christ and “moral revolution” might be a bit confused, but one thing is clear: such a radical speech made by the President of a nation is quite extraordinary, and can only be welcomed by all progressive people of the world. It was, for that matter, a very inspiring start to an exciting week that will be spent with revolutionaries from all over the world.",NA,NA

													Klaus M","As Goethe once said, “All theory, dear friend, is grey, but the golden tree of life springs ever green.” This statement completely applies to the situation in Venezuela. We have written many pamphlets, articles, and books on the revolutionary situation in Venezuela, but it is actually being in Venezuela that is the best way to confirm these theories. The festival is really in full swing now. It has many similarities with the Social Forums we have seen around the world, but with more cultural activities. However, the focus of the program is on the political meetings and all the debates. The meetings take place all over Caracas, in public as well as rented buildings. The main centre of the Festival is the Teatro Teresa Carreño, next to the Central Park of Caracas, but the largest hall is probably the Salòn Venezuela at the Fuerte Tiuna military compound, with room for around 1600 people. Marxist.com supporters are intervening at most of the central discussions of the festival, and Alan Woods spoke today at the Salòn Venezuela about militarism (read more on this issue here ). Some of the most inspiring speakers at the festival are the Venezuelans, who continually defend the revolution and its conquests, and speak of the desire to push the revolution forward. The main slogan of the festival is “For peace and solidarity, we fight against imperialism and war”. But some seem to have gone beyond this slogan, and at most of the sessions socialism is discussed as a way of achieving peace. The mood here is revolutionary, even most of the soldiers stationed to protect and help the delegates of the festival are talking about the revolution with great sympathy. They are mainly young conscripts who, as well as the other large parts of the working class of Venezuela, have benefited from the revolution too. The volunteers of the Festival are very revolutionary as well, and many of them see their help to the Festival, as helping to spread the Venezuelan revolution to other countries. Many layers of Venezuelan society (except, of course, for the bourgeois press and the opposition in general) are helping out with the Festival, and you often feel that the state supports the Festival too. One worrying thing is the bureaucracy that one can see in the organisation of the World Festival. While thousands of volunteers work very hard to organise everything and we hear about some of them going 2 or 3 days with no sleep whatsoever, we also hear about problems and manoeuvres in all the Preparatory Committees from all over the world, including the Venezuelan Preparatory Committee. Apart from the Festival there are many little things you hear and see, which tell you about the revolutionary process here in Venezuela. For instance, you see loads upon loads of revolutionary slogans on the concrete walls of Caracas, in the form of large paintings or smaller graffiti. Imagine for instance any European or North American city that replaced huge chunks of the normal hiphop-graffiti and nametags, with slogans in support of the revolution! Slogans like “¡Uh!¡Ah!¡Chavez no se va!” and “Chavèz, amigo, el pueblo esta contigo” (Chavèz, friend, the people are with you) are quite common. In some rare places pictures of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Bolivar standing together in profile can be found, typically together with socialist slogans. On a side note, some of you might have noticed that there were local elections in Venezuela last Sunday. Chavez’s party and the other Bolivarian parties won about 80% of the total cast votes in the elections (Read more about this on venezuelanalysis.org). There were many abstentions, but this was not due to the calls of the opposition for people to abstain. Naturally, in some well off areas the abstentions were because of this, however in the strongholds of the Bolivarian revolution - the working class areas and the shantytowns - abstention was quite high because people feel that some “Chavista” candidates do not really represent them. The people trust Chavez and have no time for some councillors that talk revolution and do nothing. This does not mean that the revolution is going down hill, on the contrary, we have seen how everybody gets involved in different grassroots organisations on a community level or industrial level. Some comrades had the opportunity to visit some popular areas of Caracas and it is really amazing to hear people from all generations talking about how they work for their local Healthcare Committee, Water Committee, and Meeting Point for Women, and how all these organisations improve the living standards of the people in the barrios. Another aspect is the huge explosion that has taken place in the development of the media. People come together to set up their own radio stations and outlets. They have very few means with which to do this but do it with a lot of hope. Their aim is to provide good information and entertainment for their neighbours. Street vendors sell little books with the latest laws and they sell like hotcakes outside the schools. It is worth noting that all sales of alcohol had been prohibited from bars, liquor stores and supermarkets on the Saturday before the elections. It is also worth mentioning the fact that the Caracas metro was free on Sunday. The Venezuelan population were given measures to focus on democracy and come to the voting polls. This stands in stark contrast to the opposition’s claims of dictatorship. The second state TV channel (Vive TV) went around the areas looking for ordinary people to interview about the elections, as well as about their daily lives, and their political and social activities. Aside from the revolutionary mood at the Festival, Venezuela still has a lot of problems. On the way back and forth from the Festival area to the accommodations in Ciudad Miranda, one drives through large shantytowns, which have no water, sewers or jobs. The general rate of unemployment stands at around 11%. This can be felt in the streets of Caracas, where thieves and hustlers make the streets unsafe at night. Stories are circulating around the Festival of delegates getting mugged, threatened with guns and the like. There is a long way to go for the Venezuelan revolution, but at the moment, there is light at the end of the tunnel, especially because this Festival will help to spread the revolution a little more.",NA,NA

Organized by the McMaster University Socialist Movement, “The Struggle for Sovereignty in Latin America,” featured speakers on Guatemala, Columbia, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela. The goal of the evening was to increase awareness of the political situation in these Latin American countries and outline what Canadians can do to show their support. The meeting was held at the local 1005 Steelworkers hall in Hamilton. Hamilton is known informally as “Steeltown,” due to its status as home to some of the largest steel refineries in North America. The steelworkers are currently embroiled in a struggle to protect their pensions. Lisa Valenti of Pastors for Peace gave a moving address about her group’s efforts to provide goods from throughout North America to Cuba. She encouraged the 60 people assembled to show their support at a border crossing at the Peace Bridge in Niagara Falls on August 1. “You can join a caravan at any point. We’re very flexible,” Valenti said, when asked how to join their movement. Sheny Rodriquez and Andy Altilia spoke about efforts to increase equality for women in Guatemala. “The statistics are that 1 woman dies every day.” Programs geared to increase awareness in Guatemalan woman are currently running in the Latin American country. Larry Wells, a spokesperson from the Oakville Labour Council, spoke about the “Killer Coke Campaign,” in Columbia. More trade unionists are killed in Columbia than in any other country and Coca Cola is one of the leading offenders. Jamila Ghaddar spoke on behalf of the McMaster University Socialist Movement and presented a short address on the Canadian and American backed coup in Haiti as well as including some historical information. HOV’s Alex Grant presented a short history of the events in Venezuela and emphasized the importance of supporting the revolution. The current movement in Latin America provides a unique and powerful opportunity to provide support and solidarity while the revolution is going forward rather than after a defeat, as was the case in Chile and Nicaragua. There was an opportunity to ask questions afterwards. When the panel was asked what prevented people from becoming more active, Grant answered that “fear, was the reason for paralysis in most countries. “Nothing is more successful than success and that is why Venezuela is so dangerous to the Imperialists. It’s a positive example,” he said. After the event, people had the opportunity to meet and discuss. There was a good deal of interest in the HOV information table, with a number of people signing up to show their interest and support. The information provided on Venezuela garnered more than $100 in sales. There are currently plans in place to hold a showing of “Venezuela Bolivariana” at McMaster University in the new academic year. The DVD was one of the top sellers at the event.

			The World Festival of Students and Youth - After August, What's Next?",2005-07-12T00:00:00Z,NA,"The World Festival of Students and Youth will take place this August 7-15th in Caracas, Venezuela. The theme of this festival is international, anti-imperialist solidarity. That is a very fitting theme for a festival taking place in Caracas.As has been reported on www.handsoffvenezuela.org, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is under the very serious threat of intervention and attack at the hands of U.S. imperialism. That is why we must take the lessons we learn at this festival and use them to generate defense action here at home! The Venezuelan revolution must be defended as an example to all of Latin America and to the world. In Venezuela, the people rose. From the grass roots level, the people have founded their own democracy. They have overcome attack from within and from without. They elected their own president, they smashed the short lived U.S.-backed coup, they defeated the recall referendum with overwhelming participation, and they have passed laws on land reform and established worker-controlled factories a number of times. This revolutionary process is a shining example to us all. Now, the revolution is under heavy pressure from Washington. The Bush regime has expressed its “concern” about the events in Venezuela and would like nothing more than to see a restoration of the old system. The rich Venezuelan oligarchy are snuggled nicely in the U.S. ruling class’ back pocket (right next to their wallet). With enemies like these, the revolution needs all the help it can get. We saw that in Nicaragua and Granada. Because the Venezuelan revolutionary process is at a decisive stage, where the people will see it through to the socialist end or the oligarchy and the foreign capitalist puppetmasters will destroy it, an international defense network is needed. There must be an organized network, fighting for the right to self determination without foreign interference of semi-colonial countries such as Venezuela. How do we help? The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, founded in December 2002, has been at the forefront of this defense through its various public events, appeals and petitions, fundraisers, and educational analysis. Now that campaign is expanding.The campaign is launching HOV coalitions across the U.S. and the world to educate and rally people at the local level. Also, it isn’t too late to sign the Hands Off Venezuela appeal ! The more signatures we can get, the more we can show the people of Venezuela and the gangsters in Washington that we support the Venezuelan workers and poor and we will all see it through to the end. The aims of the U.S. HOV campaign are clear: The U.S. Hands Off Venezuela Campaign opposes all forms of intervention by the U.S. government and its agencies in Venezuela and works to:",NA,NA

													Hands Off Venezuela","The Hands Off Venezuela campaign had a good presence in today’s anti-G8 protests in Edinburgh. A couple of London based supporters joined their comrades in Edinburgh to inform the protesters about what is happening in Venezuela. “Make poverty history” was the main slogan visible in the Meadows where a wide range of groupings gathered. Primarily the finger was pointed to the terrible plight of African people dying from starvation. Hands Off Venezuela tried to focus on the miserable conditions people in Latin America are forced to live in. At the same time the campaign also tried to bring the message that a real change is possible and that this change is being implemented in Venezuela. Whilst the majority of the population still live in poverty, it is clear that the Bolivarian revolution has shaken the country from top to bottom and has brought about a considerable improvement to the lives of ordinary people. The literacy programs, access to healthcare for poor people, land reforms have all served to tackle poverty in a very rich country where the majority of the people have nevertheless been living in deep poverty for ages. Our intervention, however, was not merely to cheerlead the formidable achievements that have been made through the revolution. We had very lively debates with interested people discussing the history of the country, the events surrounding the 2002 coup and most importantly, the way forward. What are the lessons to be learnt from the last few years? Since president Hugo Chavez repeatedly stated that capitalism cannot be reformed and that we have to go forward to socialism, this issue proved a very interesting point of debate. Plenty of our leaflets were distributed, books, pamphlets and DVDs were sold, raising more than 100 pounds in total.

The RMT congress took place in Exeter in South West England from June 26 to Friday July 1. The RMT has been very supportive of the Venezuelan revolution for a number of years and has been closely collaborating with the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. A delegation from the RMT, including general secretary Bob Crow and president Tony Donaghey, was present at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre earlier this year when Chavez made the speech in which he said that the Bolivarian revolution had to go towards socialism. A whole number of RMT branches have also affiliated to the campaign and the union's president spoke at the recent public meeting in London with UNT representative Anastacio Rodriguez . Speaking to the RMT conference on Monday, June 27, Ruben Linares thanked the RMT for having invited him to attend their conference and explained the basic aims of the Venezuelan Revolution and how they have improved the conditions of working people and trade unionists. He explained how the new Bolivarian constitution had become a weapon of struggle: ""Our revolution is armed, it is armed with this constitution,"" he said, showing the delegates one of the pocket size editions everybody in Venezuela carries. Ruben also described how the policies of Thatcherism, ""which started in your country 25 years ago, also hurt our peoples, the policies of privatisation and neoliberalism"". The Bolivarian Revolution ""has put an end to privatisations, no more privatisations,"" he emphasised, describing this move as part of a continent-wide rejection of Thatcherism in Latin America, including the uprising in Arequipa, Peru, ""which defeated the privatisation of electricity"". Ruben Linares, a very powerful speaker, described how Chavez has said that the only way forward is socialism ""and socialism is what we are building in Venezuela, taking into account the local conditions"". The mood in the conference was electric as delegates identified with the revolutionary spirit he was bringing from Venezuela. Ruben Linares ended his speech paraphrasing Che Guevara: ""Let those who are born know, let those who are yet to be born know, the workers are on struggle, and we were born to be victorious, we were not born to be defeated""! The whole conference exploded in a heartfelt standing ovation. Three quarters of all delegates signed the Hands Off Venezuela petition, and many took information and leaflets from the campaign and were generally very enthusiastic to get involved. By the end of the day, most delegates were wearing the distinctive Hands Off Venezuela stickers and pledged to take the message back to their branches and regions.

													Hands Off Venezuela","The Hands off Venezuela Campaign held an excellent meeting at the University of London Union last night. More than 100 people attended the meeting to hear Ruth Winters (President of the FBU), Jorge Martin (International Secretary HoV), John McDonnell MP, Anastacio Rodriguez (teacher and UNT leader), and Jeremy Dear (General Secretary NUJ) who chaired the meeting, speak on the Venezuelan revolution and the need to continue building international solidarity. Ruth Winters, Fire Brigades Union (FBU) President, started off by explaining the FBU’s long tradition of international solidarity, which includes solidarity campaigns for Cuba, Colombia, Iraq and Palestine. She compared the Colombian government to the one government in the region that actually governs in favour of working people – Cuba. To this we can now add Venezuela. The FBU president explained that opposition was growing all across the world to the imperialist policies of the IMF and the World Bank, and that Chavez, like Castro, is not afraid to lead this opposition and criticise these policies. We must never forget that there are powerful vested interests in defeating the progressive movement in Venezuela. She urged all trade unions to keep these issues at the forefront, and to fight for truth, especially in the media. She ended by saying that the National Executive of the FBU had just ratified its affiliation to the Hands off Venezuela campaign, and that it was necessary to educate union members about the significance and meaning of what was happening in Venezuela. She expressed her pride in the FBU’s role in the Hands off Venezuela Campaign and that the FBU was proud to assist in building the campaign. Jorge Martin, International Secretary of the Hands off Venezuela Campaign, having visited Venezuela several times over the last few years, was able to give a concrete picture to the revolution unfolding there. He began by explaining why the Hands off Venezuela Camapign believes that a revolution is taking place in Venezuela. The definition of revolution is when ordinary working people take their future into their own hands. This could clearly be seen in the Recall Referendum in August of last year, when 100,000 Electoral Platoons, each with 10 members, were organized to mobilise the population and to campaign in the referendum. This was an example of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Venezuelan people, where 1 million people in a country of 25 million were organized to mobilise support in elections. Jorge also explained the massive influence of the Venezuelan revolution throughout Latin America. A new wave of hope has spread across Latin America as a result of the Venezuelan revolution. In the past, many left-wing leaders and governments were elected in Latin America, but if they ever actually tried to do anything meaningful, they would face a coup, as was the case in Chile in the 1970s. Something similar happened in Venezuela in 2002, except that the masses came out to the streets and defeated the coup. This is an enormous inspiration to people all across Latin America, and shows that it is possible to fight, and to win. Jorge ended by explaining the importance of Chavez raising the debate on socialism. For the first time in a long time, since the fall of the Berlin Wall 15 years ago, the question of socialism has been raised – and not by some small group, but by the president of a country and the leader of a mass movement. Everywhere across Venezuela, workers and peasants are debating and discussing how to build socialism in Venezuela. Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary and chairman of the meeting, explained that because of the militant, democratic traditions and methods of the UNT, that the UNT had now become the largest trade union federation in Venezuela. He also informed the audience that Orlando Chirino, a UNT leader and the scheduled speaker for the meeting, could not be there due to a death in his family during the ILO Conference in Geneva. Anastacio Rodriguez, a leader of the Teacher’s Federation and UNT coordinator, and UNT representative at the ILO Conference in Geneva, came to speak in his stead. Anastacio explained that before Chavez, Venezuela was in a mess. Millions of people had no chance of ever going to school and getting an education. When the Venezuelans looked for a model and an example in order to change their system, they only saw one system capable of creating a mass education system – the Cuban system. The education and health care misiones in Venezuela have been a success. 1 million people have participated in literacy programmes, and 1.6 million people have been able to continue their education and complete high school. With the introduction of the misiones, 52% of the population are in school. That is a revolution. The mision barrio adentro (inside the neighbourhood), the most extensive of Venezuela’s health missions, has provided some 56 million consultations, providing free healthcare and medicine to millions of people. That is a revolution. He ended by explaining the importance of the UNT. For 50 years, nobody, not even the government could see the accounts of the old trade union federation, the CTV. Then the CTV assisted in the coup. He explained that the workers had broken the control of the bureaucracy, and that they now controlled their own union. Many different people attended the meeting, who after the main speeches participated in a lively discussion. There were members of UNISON, the RMT, AMICUS, the FBU, the NUJ, and several other unions as well as members of many different solidarity campaigns. Andy Higginbottom of the Colombia Solidarity Campaign (CSC) spoke about some of the developments in Colombia, and the importance of the Venezuelan revolution to the Colombia people. He explained the importance of building the boycott Coca-Cola campaign, and the BP (British Petroleum) campaign for all of Latin America. He ended by saying that if Gordon Brown and Bob Geldof were serious about solving the Third World debt crisis they had to do something serious about UK corporations who operate in these countries, rather than simply shed crocodile tears. Amancay Colque of the Bolivia Solidarity Campaign explained that Bolivia was the poorest country in Latin America. George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice have blamed Chavez and the Venezuelan government for recent events in Bolivia. This is simply not true, and the events have nothing to do with Venezuela, but everything to do with BP, Esso, and Exxon. She pointed out that the struggle in Bolivia is the same struggle that is being fought here. She asked the audience to imagine the struggle for the nationalisation of the railways. The trade unionists present at the meeting were asked to sign a petition of support for the Bolivian workers and peasants. Lula and Kirchner have sent advisors to Bolivia to support the Bolivian bourgeoisie, hence it is extremely important that trade unionists and workers from around the world support trade unionists and workers in Bolivia, who are fighting for their rights and their future. RMT President Tony Donaghey, expressed solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution and his pride in the RMT’s affiliation to the campaign. The Venezuelan revolution stands as an example to all people struggling for social reforms and their rights, including here in the UK. The UK is supposed to be the fourth richest country in earth, yet what do we see here? More cuts, privatisation, and poverty. The reforms in Venezuela, are an example of what many people need here in the UK. Many people were pleased at the achievements of the UNT, its independence and its accountability, adding that they wished something similar could be established here. Others explained that the best way to build solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution was to build the class struggle here in the UK, because the more we attack and weaken the ruling class here, the less able they will be to attack Venezuela. John McDonnell, honorary president of the HoV campaign, explained that the Venezuelan revolution, and the drive to create a truly democratic society, was an inspiration to the entire world. He explained that we have the straightforward task of building the campaign in a broad, non-sectarian way. Solidarity campaigns have always been infiltrated in the past, in order that these campaigns and movements can be split and derailed. It is necessary to bring different groups together, because in the past, as Jeremy Corbyn MP pointed out at a previous meeting, for example around the events in Chile, we always mobilised after the events, after a coup for example. Now we have the opportunity to campaign beforehand, to protect the revolution, and to mobilise against the counter-revolution. He explained that although we all come from different political backgrounds and organisations, that the HoV campaign is an excellent way to come together and build solidarity. It is necessary to transmit the success of the campaign down to individual unions, branches, and political organisations and get them to affiliate to the campaign. It will also be necessary to transmit this success upwards, and get the TUC to commit to solidarity and to affiliate to the campaign. He mentioned the importance of putting pressure on the Labour government. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (or as McDonnell described it, the Outreach Centre for the CIA) has made no comment on Venezuela in anyway. It is obvious that all ministers in the FCO have been warned off from saying anything on Venezuela. It is necessary to press the government and all ministers for their opinion on Venezuela, and to explain to them the democratic system there and the significance of events. He ended by saying that new words, such as “globalisation” etc. have disappeared, and that people have reverted to using “imperialism” and “exploitation”. Our analysis has won, and we must explain and go back to these straightforward categories. We must sustain the revolution against imperialist aggression. We must build solidarity, and build the campaign. McDonnell then thanked the campaign for providing the ideas and the organization, and for pushing the movement forward. A £180 collection was raised for the Hands off Venezuela campaign. At the end of the meeting, many of the participants went to the campus pub to continue to discussions informally. Everyone left the meeting enthused and determined to build the campaign, and to build solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution.

													Hands Off Venezuela","     El 8 de agosto vio la inauguración de la 16ª edición del Festival Mundial de la Juventud y los Estudiantes (FMJE) que se está celebrando en Caracas este año. Bajo el lema “Por la paz, la solidaridad y contra el imperialismo”, más de 15,000 jóvenes de todo el globo terráqueo se han reunido para discutir una amplia gama de temas; todos ellos de carácter antiimperialista. El 8 de agosto vio la inauguración de la 16ª edición del Festival Mundial de la Juventud y los Estudiantes (FMJE) que se está celebrando en Caracas este año. Bajo el lema “Por la paz, la solidaridad y contra el imperialismo”, más de 15,000 jóvenes de todo el globo terráqueo se han reunido para discutir una amplia gama de temas; todos ellos de carácter antiimperialista.  El gobierno venezolano está promocionando este importante acto y abrió la Academia Militar en Fuerte Tiuna para recibir a los delegados para la apertura oficial del festival. Delegados de una impresionante cantidad de 144 países de todos los continentes desfilaron en esta ceremonia de apertura. La delegación cubana era de las más grandes con 1,800 presentes y hubo unos 2,000 delegados de Colombia; la delegación venezolana fue la más numerosa con más de 3,000 delegados. Los asistentes a la ceremonia se llevaron una grata sorpresa cuando vieron una delegación de los Estados Unidos con 720 jóvenes.  Los delegados fueron saludados al grito de “Bienvenidos a la República Socialista Bolivariana de Venezuela”, después de que las delegaciones marcharan delante del Presidente Chávez hubo actuaciones de folclore indígena. Representantes guaraníes y de otros pueblos indígenas venezolanos obsequiaron a Hugo Chávez con diferentes objetos que representan sus diversas culturas.  Igualmente impresionante fue el equipo de voluntarios que dieron la bienvenida a los visitantes. A parte de los equipos de traducción, los de aprovisionamientos y Guardia Nacional, una considerable sección de la juventud bolivariana se unió a la marcha cantando canciones, consignas y danzando.  Al final de la marcha cuando todas las delegaciones habían marchado hacia la plaza principal y después de todas las actuaciones, el presidente Chávez inauguró el festival. Después de una larga espera, Chávez se dirigió a los miles de jóvenes (y los no tan jóvenes) que escucharon con mucha atención lo que el tenía que decir. Él empezó mirando 60 años hacia atrás, cuando las bombas atómicas cayeron en Hiroshima y Nagasaki. El Presidente Chávez pagó tributo a las víctimas de este genocidio y condenó estos actos de terrorismo. “Hoy”- el dijo – “Ha caído una bomba atómica de juventud en el valle de Caracas.” Ellos habían venido a ver Caracas, el lugar donde Simón Bolívar nació y eran más que bienvenidos al FMJE. Esto ha sido un gran reto para Venezuela y más de 2 años de preparación han sido invertidos en este evento, ha involucrado mucha coordinación y requerido mucho apoyo logístico y político.  Chávez entonces recordó los principales hechos de las últimas 6 décadas. Al final de 1940 hubo la revolución china, uno de los mayores hechos en la historia de la humanidad. Este gran hecho fue seguido por la revolución cubana una década después. Chávez describió a ésta como una tremenda inspiración para todos los pueblos de América Latina. “Este gran acontecimiento marcó el camino para el futuro”, afirmó el presidente.  En los 60 el imperialismo americano sufrió una humillante derrota en el Vietnam, cosa que probó que el Imperio no es invencible. “Un pueblo que quiere ser libre no puede ser derrotado”, el dijo, mientras alababa a la heroica resistencia vietnamita en contra del imperialismo.  Los 70 fueron un periodo de esperanza para América Latina, donde vimos el Chile de Allende, que fue desafortunadamente brutalmente machacado por el imperialismo estadounidense. El final de los 80, a su vez, significó un terremoto universal debido a la caída de la URSS. El viejo equilibrio político fue destruido y después de la caída del bloque del Este, los capitalistas declararon “el fin de la historia”. “Globalización neoliberal”- Chávez dijo – “no es más que otra palabra para imperialismo, y el imperialismo”- él continuó- “es el estadio más alto del capitalismo, como Lenin dijo”. En los 90 la palabra capitalismo había desaparecido de los diccionarios y una crisis moral y económica se desarrolló, creando un periodo de dudas y confusión. Sin embargo, como el Ave Fénix que renace de sus cenizas, el presidente explicó que los luchadores y los revolucionarios reaparecerán y que ellos de hecho ya estaban reapareciendo. “Nosotros estamos empezando un nuevo proceso, un nuevo amanecer donde las ideas de justicia, paz e igualdad serán centrales.”  Chávez también anunció que el estaba profundamente convencido que los últimos años había sido difíciles y exigentes. Sin embargo ha pesar de la gran frustración, en la primera década del siglo XXI, miles de jóvenes se han concentrado en Caracas. Según proclamó el presidente Chávez, esto apunta a mucho más que un simple sentimiento de esperanza, sino a una oportunidad de debate y de empezar la batalla de las ideas. Lo que a él incumbe, no cree en una lucha aislada en un solo país; como él ya dijo en el Foro Social Mundial en Porto Alegre al final de este año, Chávez otra vez declaró que el socialismo es el camino verdadero y la única forma de construir un nuevo mundo. “Es nuestra tarea y un reto el salvar nuestro planeta del imperialismo más poderoso que ha existido jamás, el imperialismo de los Estados Unidos.” Significativamente, Chávez no ve al pueblo estadounidense como una sola masa reaccionaria. Por el contrario, el saludó cordialmente y felicitó a la delegación de los EEUU presente en Caracas y reconoció a “los grandes luchadores del pueblo estadounidense”, mencionando a Martin Luther King. En una dramática pero válida declaración, el dijo “El futuro del mundo depende de las conciencias de los pueblos americanos; cuando ellos se unan, ellos salvaran al mundo de la guerra y la destrucción.”  Chávez luego explicó que estamos en el mejor momento para tener el festival; en estas terribles condiciones y a pesar de la existencia de la más poderosa e hipócrita forma de imperialismo en la historia. “El imperio romano” – el dijo- “por lo menos no era tan hipócrita, ya que se llamaban imperio. El imperialismo de los EEUU, por otro lado, vergonzosamente declara ‘luchar por la democracia’”, después dio ejemplos del papel de los EEUU en Chile, República Dominicana, Guatemala, Panamá y Haití entre otros prueban lo contrario. “América Latina al completo ha sufrido ataques del imperialismo estadounidense. Bolívar estaba en lo cierto cuando dijo en 1826, ‘Los Estados Unidos de América parecen destinados por la providencia a plagar América con miseria en nombre de la libertad.’”  Luego el captó la atención de la audiencia a Venezuela, “donde los Estados Unidos han sufrido algunas sorpresas desagradables.” El imperialismo estadounidense no es invencible, un hecho que no sólo se ha probado en Venezuela, sino también en Cuba, donde el pueblo revolucionario ha luchado contra el imperialismo por más de 40 años. Chávez felicitó a Fidel Castro, quien está mirando su discurso que fue retransmitido en todos los canales venezolanos públicos y Tele Sur. “Nosotros venimos aquí a debatir sobre paz, pero si a los halcones del Pentágono les decimos que si se les ocurre la loca idea de venir a invadirnos, les haremos morder el polvo defendiendo la libertad de nuestra tierra.” dijo el presidente mientras la multitud coreó “pueblo armado, pueblo respetado”.  “La lucha de Venezuela es la lucha de los pueblos del mundo”, proclamó Chávez mientras el empezó a resumir su inspirador discurso. El recordó las palabras de Jean-Paul Sastre, quien en los 60 visitó Cuba y escribió “las condiciones y circunstancias hicieron que empezará una revolución”, el hizo un llamamiento a una revolución moral para salvar al mundo y abogó por un “humanismo revolucionario”, pero también dijo que esto no es suficiente. “Una revolución política es necesaria – una revolución política y democrática, pero no una democracia falsa sino una democracia real, como en Venezuela.” dijo el presidente Chávez.  A modo de conclusión, repitió lo que había dicho en otros discursos, Chávez proclamó “la única forma de desmontar el perverso capitalismo es únicamente construyendo el socialismo, pero el verdadero socialismo. Esta es la única manera de salvar el mundo y las generaciones venideras”   Algún pedante seguro que podría añadir algunos puntos y comas a esto. Es cierto que algunas referencias a Jesús y a una “revolución moral” muestran confusión, pero una cosa está muy clara y es que un discurso radical como éste que viene de un presidente de una nación es bastante extraordinario, y ha de ser bienvenido por toda la gente progresista en el mundo. Fue, sin duda alguna, un buen inicio para una excitante semana que vamos a pasar con revolucionarios de todo el mundo. ",NA,NA

													Roland Schmidt","The month of May and the first couple weeks of June have seen the Canadian Hands Off Venezuela campaign firmly establish itself in the province of Alberta’s capital, Edmonton, a healthy-sized city of around 1 million people. The combination of encouraging union support and impressive initial public event turn-outs shows promise not only for the growth of the campaign in Edmonton, but in the spreading of the campaign to the province’s other major city—Calgary. Back in April, members of the Canadian Marxist Journal, Fightback, the New Democratic Youth of Alberta, the Alberta Federation of Labour Youth Committee and the Edmonton Chilean community met to discuss promoting the Bolivarian movement as well as officially getting the HoV campaign started in Edmonton. The first event planned was the June 4th free screening of the documentary “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” at the Edmonton Art Gallery movie theatre. The main purpose of this event was not to launch the HoV in Edmonton but to educate and inspire people about the Venezuelan revolution, in preparation for the campaign launch the following Saturday. Before the film began, the 74 people in attendance heard Miriam Martin, one of HoV Canada’s organizers, speak on the history and current political situation in Venezuela. During the film the audience was very vocal of their disgust towards the perspective put forward by Venezuela’s private media, which is notorious for its extreme and sensationalist anti-Chavez position. What drew an even more angered response from the crowd was any instance in the film when a representative of the CIA was shown expressing their “concern with President Chavez’s interpretation of democracy”. The end of the film was met with a very enthusiastic applause which segued nicely into a lively discussion that included topics ranging from the character of taxation in Venezuela, to the benefits of workers’ control of production to what we can do here in Alberta to raise awareness. On the following Saturday, June 11 th , sixteen of the more dedicated individuals who had attended the screening came to the HoV Edmonton Kick-Off meeting held at the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 30 hall, to participate in the formulation of the Edmonton campaign and once again hear Miriam Martin speak. This time Miriam focused more on the latest developments in Bolivia and their relation to Venezuela as well as how the struggle in Venezuela was coming into direct conflict with American imperialism. After her lead-off, discussion, both political and organizational, helped shape the character of the campaign in Edmonton, giving special attention to work amongst youth and organized labour. Plans were set out by the group to act upon a resolution passed in May 2005 by the Alberta Federation of Labour, a union network with over 30 union affiliates, representing over 125,000 workers in the province. The resolution called for the support of the progressive reforms being put forward by Chavez, the denunciation of foreign aggression against Venezuela, and for solidarity to be established between the labour movement here and the Bolivarian movement in Venezuela. The feeling was that this resolution would be the perfect pressure mechanism to encourage the AFL to take that extra step in endorsing the HoV on top of encouraging the AFL’s affiliates to endorse the campaign themselves. Presentation meetings are already being set up with many major unions to achieve these ends. One of the most exiting opportunities is the potential for the Edmonton group to help bring over one of HoV’s main international organizers via a University of Alberta program called the “Revolutionary Speakers’ Series”. In the past this series has brought over people like Ralph Nader and Michael Moore. Although not exactly “revolutionary”, this does exemplify the ability of the series to bring in influential individuals. The freshly formed organizational committee has already set their meeting for the upcoming Friday, June 17, to iron out a division of labour for the organizers and plans for a screening of the other acclaimed documentary on Venezuela entitled “Venezuela Bolivariana”. Also, some of the organizers will be going down to Calgary shortly to meet with interested parties there in hopes of setting up a Calgary branch.

													Ray Smith in Glasgow","On the occasion of the National Conference of UNISON (public sector workers union) the Hands Off Venezuela and the Colombia Solidarity Campaign supporters in UNISON organised a meeting on the evening of June 22 to catch the attention of the delegates attending the conference of the biggest trade union in Britain. The appeal of the meeting went beyond the UNISON conference and there were several students from the University of Glasgow, some Labour party members as well as Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) members who were responsible for organising the meeting. Andy Higginbottom, Colombia Solidarity Campaign Secretary, opened the meeting. Andy explained the relationship between paramilitaries, government and multinational companies in Colombia who are right behind the onslaught that the social and trade union movement has suffered over 20 years. This repression has worsened since Uribe Velez was elected as president of Colombia in 2003. Andy illustrated the level of collaboration of the Colombian army and the paramilitaries by saying that the same soldiers wear the armbands of the Colombian army and the AUC (the main far right paramilitary group), depending of the actions they are going to execute. He also presented the Coca-Cola boycott as a tactic to denounce the violence that this company is employing against their workers in Colombia. Ramon Samblas, Hands Off Venezuela spokesperson, followed on by explaining the improvements that the Venezuelan Revolution has brought about. It was really inspiring to hear that four new universities had opened their door with the aim of providing education to these layers in society that had never had this chance before. “But all of that [the social programmes on housing, education and healthcare] has not been free from harassment and attacks from the US administration and the Venezuelan oligarchy. They can see that their power is slipping through their fingers and they have organised reactionary attempts to defeat this movement,” Ramon said to the audience. He went on explaining the different attacks on the part of US imperialism against Venezuela: coup d’etats, lock-outs, terrorism, diplomatic harassment, amongst other. The HOV activist reported on the experiences of workers’ co-management and finished up his contribution explaining the need for “going all the way through”, completing the process and install socialism in the country. The debate that Hugo Chavez has sparked about the need of the Venezuelan Revolution to follow a socialist path will help for sure. Rosie Kane, SSP Member of the Scottish Parliament reported on her trip to Cuba where she had the chance to meet Fidel Castro. The MSP was invited to Cuba to attend an international event where people from all over Latin America and beyond denounced the crimes of imperialism. During three days, hundreds of people gave accounts of the abuse and violence they had suffered because of the terrorist methods of US imperialism. All these accounts were broadcast by Cuban TV which reaches the neighbouring islands and some Latin American countries. While in Cuba, Rosie spoke on Western hypocrisy and the need of tackling it together with the system that sustains it, capitalism. In her contribution, she despised British media because of the lack of interest in the struggle of the Cuban people against US imperialism. She illustrated this with an anecdote that happened to her the day after she came back from Cuba. A Guardian journalist phoned her and asked her, “What do you think about the architecture of Scottish Parliament building?” Her answer was “For Christ’s sake, I have met the leader of the Cuban Revolution and you are asking me about the Scottish Parliament Building!” She finished her contribution by saying that we have to support all the revolutionary movements that are taking in Latin America and the groups that are developing solidarity with these movements from Britain. When the main speaker, Colombian trade unionist Juan Carlos Galvis started his speech there were 80 people packed in the room. Extra chairs had to be brought in to accommodate everybody. Some people had to stay outside because there was not enough space for them all. Juan Carlos spoke on behalf of SINALTRAINAL (Colombian beverages and food workers union) about the actions that the trade union had taken at a worldwide level against the abuse and violence that his trade union had suffered by Coca-Cola. Juan Carlos has been working for this company for 16 years. He explained how SINALTRAINAL had opened four court cases against this company in the United States with the help of one of the US trade union that organise workers in the food and beverages industry. Horrifying examples were given of the level of violence against them by Coca-Cola altogether with the Colombian paramilitaries. The only “crime” they had committed was to organise workers and stand up for their rights. Amongst the methods used is the hiring of paramilitaries to kidnap, threaten and assassinate his trade union colleagues and the accusations of “rebellion”. In Colombia this is the first step to be accused of colluding with the guerrilla groups to “justify” the assassination of trade union, student or peasant activists. Jorge Humberto Bernal is one of Juan Carlos comrades. He was kidnapped by the paramilitaries in Cucuta. He was abducted, blindfolded and thrown into the back of a van. After he was driven around the city of Cucuta for 45 minutes, he was brought to a room where he was shown pictures of a SINALTRAINAL protest outside Coca-Cola bottling plant. He was told that if SINALTRAINAL carried out more protests, he and his comrades would be killed. Juan Carlos himself had suffered the threats of the paramilitaries. The Colombian brother also explained the origins of the World campaign against Coke. After the company refused to even respond a document with basic demands to stop the violence against their own workforce SINALTRAINAL decided to launch a worldwide boycott against Coca-Cola in July 2003. After two years, the boycott has supporters in Britain, Ireland, Spain, France, Switzerland, US, Canada, Bolivia, Argentina, Venezuela and many more countries. Juan Carlos finished his speech vowing to fight against multinationals and therefore against capitalist globalisation. His speech was welcome with a standing ovation. Juan Carlos replied saying that the applause must go to all these that have shown solidarity with his Colombian fellow trade unionists. A lively debate developed with some UNISON delegates asking other UNISON delegates to support the Hands Off Venezuela motion due to be debated at the Conference the very next day. Others asked for practical ways to implement the boycott and the question what to do to stop imperialist intervention against Cuba and Venezuela was raised. There were also people from the audience that highlighted the revolutionary movements in Bolivia and Ecuador. Above all, there was a feeling in the audience to go out and build solidarity with the movements that will expel imperialism from the continent and build a socialist society.

													Emanuel Tomaselli, Hände weg von Venezuela","The Hands off Venezuela campaign was established in Austria following the international appeal made in December 2002. We started our work with the distribution of the international appeal and the collection of signatures in defence of the Venezuelan revolution. The main force behind the campaign at this time was Der Funke . From the very beginning we directed the campaign towards the labour movement, in particular towards the Young Socialists (YS) and shop stewards. We have used conferences, district meetings and branches to move resolutions, distribute leaflets and hold public discussions in order to spread awareness of the developments in Venezuela and in the labour movement. At the last national conference of the YS in October 2004 HoV supporters submitted a resolution calling for the expulsion of counterrevolutionary organisations from the IUSY (the International Union of Socialist Youth). This resolution created a heated debate and received the support of many delegates. In January 2004 the campaign organised a speaking tour with Hermann Albrecht, a trade union activist from Venezuela. During the recall referendum we showed our support for the revolutionary process by holding a rally in front of the Venezuelan embassy in Vienna and explained our perspectives for the Venezuelan revolution: “Hands off Venezuela – forward to socialism”. Just two months later the campaign, which had in the meantime established a close relationship with the Bolivarian Circle of Vienna, successfully thwarted an esqualido (a term used to describe the opposition in Venezuela) meeting by picketing the venue. The notorious ProVeO (Pro Venezuela Organization) tried to use the prestigious “Latin American Institute” to promote their anti-democratic positions in Austria. This was the first and last public meeting of the so-called “opposition” to be held in Austria, and was a big success for the international campaign. At the Austrian Social Forum (ASF) in Linz in June 2004, the HoV campaign held a joint meeting together with the Communist Party of Austria. Despite the fact that Oskar Lafontaine was speaking at the same time, more than 40 people came to the meeting, making it one of the biggest single-issue meetings at the forum. The campaign then also took part in the organisation of the World Youth Festival to be held this August in Venezuela. Through all these activities and through the inspiring example of the Venezuelan Revolution itself, we were able to build and involve other political forces in the campaign. A meeting was held last weekend with several people representing different organisations, currents and campaigns in order to discuss the perspectives of the revolution in Latin America and the basis for a joint effort to spread awareness of what is happening in Venezuela. Several organizations were represented including: the YS Vienna and several district organisations of the YS, the youth organisation of the Trade Union of Private Employees, the Austrian-Cuban Friendship-Association, Energy for Cuba, the Bolivarian Circle and the Marxist tendency Der Funke . Jorge Martin, international secretary of the Hands off Venezuela campaign, was the special guest and gave those present an insight into the history, development, principles, and successes of the campaign. Despite differing angles, stresses and perspectives, all participants agreed on the basic idea of establishing a campaign to defend the Venezuelan and Cuban revolutions. The meeting passed a joint resolution. The campaign agreed on three main objectives for the work of the campaign in Austria: The next step for the campaign will be to establish a jointly managed www.haendewegvonvenezuela.org website which should be online sometime in July. All the organisations, currents and campaigns that agree to the basic resolution of the campaign will have access to the website to publish material on Venezuela and Cuba. There will also be discussion forums on the website. A special section will also be maintained in order to keep a close eye on corporate media reports on Venezuela. Although all the ideas could not be discussed in depth at the plenary discussion due to a lack of time, all participants felt that the most difficult first step had been taken and that many more things would be undertaken by the “Hands off Venezuela” campaign in Austria. As a final remark we would like to highlight a contribution made by a shop steward who was present at the meeting. Just a few weeks ago a delegate to the national conference of the ÖGJ (Trade Union Youth of Austria) raised the example of Venepal, the CNV and workers’ control of industry in Venezuela in general in the debate about the nationalisation of key industries. These examples helped the young trade unionists to sharpen their position on this vital issue. The ÖGJ now demands the complete nationalisation of Austrian industry under workers’ control. This graphically shows that the revolution in Venezuela and Latin America is an inspiration to the most advanced layers of the working class in Europe. The experience of our comrades in Venezuela will help to sharpen their ideas, methods and programmes in order to fight capitalism in imperialist countries.

During the recall referendum we showed our support for the revolutionary process by holding a rally in front of the Venezuelan embassy in Vienna and explained our perspectives for the Venezuelan revolution: “Hands off Venezuela – forward to socialism”. Just two months later the campaign, which had in the meantime established a close relationship with the Bolivarian Circle of Vienna, successfully thwarted an esqualido (a term used to describe the opposition in Venezuela) meeting by picketing the venue. The notorious ProVeO (Pro Venezuela Organization) tried to use the prestigious “Latin American Institute” to promote their anti-democratic positions in Austria. This was the first and last public meeting of the so-called “opposition” to be held in Austria, and was a big success for the international campaign. At the Austrian Social Forum (ASF) in Linz in June 2004, the HoV campaign held a joint meeting together with the Communist Party of Austria. Despite the fact that Oskar Lafontaine was speaking at the same time, more than 40 people came to the meeting, making it one of the biggest single-issue meetings at the forum. The campaign then also took part in the organisation of the World Youth Festival to be held this August in Venezuela. Through all these activities and through the inspiring example of the Venezuelan Revolution itself, we were able to build and involve other political forces in the campaign. A meeting was held last weekend with several people representing different organisations, currents and campaigns in order to discuss the perspectives of the revolution in Latin America and the basis for a joint effort to spread awareness of what is happening in Venezuela. Several organizations were represented including: the YS Vienna and several district organisations of the YS, the youth organisation of the Trade Union of Private Employees, the Austrian-Cuban Friendship-Association, Energy for Cuba, the Bolivarian Circle and the Marxist tendency Der Funke . Jorge Martin, international secretary of the Hands off Venezuela campaign, was the special guest and gave those present an insight into the history, development, principles, and successes of the campaign. Despite differing angles, stresses and perspectives, all participants agreed on the basic idea of establishing a campaign to defend the Venezuelan and Cuban revolutions. The meeting passed a joint resolution. The campaign agreed on three main objectives for the work of the campaign in Austria: The next step for the campaign will be to establish a jointly managed www.haendewegvonvenezuela.org website which should be online sometime in July. All the organisations, currents and campaigns that agree to the basic resolution of the campaign will have access to the website to publish material on Venezuela and Cuba. There will also be discussion forums on the website. A special section will also be maintained in order to keep a close eye on corporate media reports on Venezuela. Although all the ideas could not be discussed in depth at the plenary discussion due to a lack of time, all participants felt that the most difficult first step had been taken and that many more things would be undertaken by the “Hands off Venezuela” campaign in Austria. As a final remark we would like to highlight a contribution made by a shop steward who was present at the meeting. Just a few weeks ago a delegate to the national conference of the ÖGJ (Trade Union Youth of Austria) raised the example of Venepal, the CNV and workers’ control of industry in Venezuela in general in the debate about the nationalisation of key industries. These examples helped the young trade unionists to sharpen their position on this vital issue. The ÖGJ now demands the complete nationalisation of Austrian industry under workers’ control. This graphically shows that the revolution in Venezuela and Latin America is an inspiration to the most advanced layers of the working class in Europe. The experience of our comrades in Venezuela will help to sharpen their ideas, methods and programmes in order to fight capitalism in imperialist countries.",NA,NA

Many US representatives, first and foremost Condoleezza Rice, has called Chavez a ""negative force"" in the region. Since the attempted coup, the US government has been beating the war drums while making preparations for war against Venezuela. The underlying motivation of the US government is clear: the Chavez government has been shifting the benefits from the country's oil wealth from the rich giant corporations to the vast majority of the population by providing food, housing, health care and education. Moreover, Hugo Chavez has recently spoken out against US ""free market"" policies that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy few. He has nationalized some industries and has declared Venezuela's right to institute democratic socialism to further this development. He also opposes the U.S. war in Iraq. The stakes are high. Therefore, we believe it is vitally necessary for all those in the US and around the world to affirm Venezuela's right to determine its own destiny by joining forces to forge a resistance to the US government's aggressive aims. The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign has started meeting in San Francisco to try and raise awareness about the inspiring events in Venezuela and to organize against the threats against them from the US government.

The discussion dealt with participatory democracy, alternative media, the incredible advances that have given millions of people access to education and healthcare, and the inspiring nationalization under workers' control of Venepal and CNV. The call was made for the BC labour movement to recognize and support Venezuela's growing democratic trade union federation, the UNT (National Union of Workers).

													Hands Off Venezuela London"," Cuban-Venezuelan Luis Posada is wanted for blowing up an airliner in 1976, killing 73 people. He was arrested last month in the US, which is refusing to hand him over to Venezuela, where he escaped from jail. His partner in crime, Orlando Bosch, was given a presidential pardon by Bush the Elder and now lives in Miami, where they have named a street after him. In Colombia this year a total of seven US soldiers (including a colonel) have been arrested for, between them, selling ammunition to right-wing paramilitaries and attempting to smuggle cocaine into the US. Before the Colombian judiciary could blink, they were whisked out of the country to prevent further embarrassment and have not yet been charged with any crime. Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used to be President of Bolivia, before he ordered the massacre of peaceful protesters in 2003 and fled to Miami to escape the furious backlash. Bolivians want him tried for crimes against humanity, but that doesn't seem likely while he's protected by the US government, who immediately granted him political asylum. Notice a pattern? The problem for Bush is that these cases all reveal the ugly underside of US foreign policy in Latin America. Declassified FBI documents prove Posada was a CIA agent (specialising in explosives) while also freelancing for the Las Vegas mafia. After escaping Venezuelan jail in 1985 he worked for Oliver North supplying arms to the US-backed Contras in their war against the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua. His terrorist career continues in Cuba (where he had been a policeman under the Batista dictatorship) with a string of hotel bombings during an international youth festival in 1997, resulting in several injuries and the death of an Italian tourist. In an interview with the New York Times the following year Posada practically boasted about this terrorism. He was part of the infamous Operation Condor, which co-ordinated right-wing military dicatorships in the region for the US government, and has tried to assassinate Castro at least twice: once in Caracas in 1971 (while head of DISIP, the Venezuelan political police) and again in 2000 in Panama, where he served four years in jail before being pardoned by the outgoing president (who now lives in Florida). On Monday 13th June, there will be an immigration hearing in El Paso, Texas, to decide Posada's fate. The case has become a major headache for George Bush, as Posada is hailed as a hero amongst the rich right-wing Castro-hating Miami Cubans who form a key component of his (and especially his brother's) base of support. However, refusal to extradite Posada will clearly make a mockery of the whole ""War on Terror"". Posada is a 77-year-old man who has lead a lifetime of terrorism directed against progressive movements in Latin America. The embarrassing fact that this terror was in line with US foreign policy and supported by the US government doesn't make harbouring him any less hypocritical.

Twenty-seven activists from around the Bay discussed the need to mobilize against the U.S. government's attempts to destabilize and topple the popular democratic government in Venezuela. This meeting was organized as a broad-based, democratically structured, united front coalition on the basis of defending Venezuela's right to self-determination. However, in the process of mobilizing people around this principle, we want to take every opportunity to educate the American public about the revolutionary process unfolding in Venezuela. Those attending this meeting were individuals who came from a wide range of socialist groups in the Bay Area, including Socialist Action, International Socialist Organization, the Workers International League, Socialist Viewpoint, Socialist Organizer, Labor's Militant Voice, and Workers Action, as well as individuals who were not affiliated with any organization. John Peterson from the National HOV campaign was also present. We hope to reach out to many more groups and independents for our future meetings. One of the more significant recent developments in Venezuela has been the creation of a massive new labor movement, the National Workers Union (UNT), that has replaced the former U.S. funded, pro-employer union federation. The initial project of SF Bay HOV, unanimously adopted at this meeting, will be to bring a prominent leader of the UNT to the San Francisco Bay Area so that people here can begin to learn about the exciting developments in Venezuela. This will mark a tremendous step forward for the U.S. HOV campaign as a whole. We'll have more details on this important visit soon.

The Open Letter, launched by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, draws attention to the belligerent statements of the Bush administration against Venezuela and warns that this is the kind of language that in the past has been used to prepare for war and intervention. The Open Letter therefore calls on trade unionists in the US to put pressure on Washington to prevent any further US interference in Venezuela. Among the Bolivian leaders signing the appeal are Miguel Zubieta, the main leader of the Bolivian Miners’ Trade Union Federation (FSMTB); Angel Durand, leader of the Landless Peasants Movement (MST); Felipe Quispe ""El Mallku"", leader of the Pachacutik Indian Movement (MIP) and one of the country’s most respected Indian leaders; Abel Mamani, the leader of the El Alto Neighbourhood Juntas Federation, which played a key role in the mobilisations which brought down the Sanchez Lozada government in October 2003; and Carlos Luna, the leader of the El Alto State University Students Centre (UPEA). Also signing the appeal are three of the country’s most well known political prisoners: the Colombian peasant leader Pacho Cortés, who has already spent two years in jail wrongly accused of ""narco-terrorism""; Gabriel Pinto, leader of the MST who has already been in jail for nearly a year, accused of having participated in the Ayo-Ayo uprising; and Marcelino Jancko, a founding member of the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), leader of the Chaparé peasants and jailed since April 2003 on trumped up charges of ""carrying explosives"". The Peruvian militant Cesar Zelada, coordinator of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign in Perú, who also spent three months in jail in Bolivia on trumped up charges of ""carrying explosives"" also signs the appeal.

			One of the largest European trade unions supports Venezuela",2005-05-19T00:00:00Z,"
															
													our industrial correspondent","As part of this campaigning work the Hands Off Venezuela supporters in the union organised a fringe meeting on Saturday evening to highlight the revolutionary process in this Latin American country and to rally support for Venezuela against the threat of imperialist intervention on the part of the USA. There was a thorough debate at the meeting with those taking part asking a lot of questions about what is happening in Venezuela. On Sunday May 15, a delegate for General Industries, and also a Hands Off Venezuela supporter, Espe Espigares presented a resolution that appealed to the conference and the union as a whole to pledge support for “the revolutionary movement of the Venezuelan people in their struggle for socialist equality and justice” and also for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. She explained how the USA is pointing the finger at Venezuela as rogue state, but she answered this by giving facts and figures about what the Bolivarian revolution is actually achieving for the poor masses, including the literacy campaign, healthcare etc. And she added that these are the kinds of policies we would like to see here in Britain, and therefore it is the duty of the labour movement in Britain and throughout the world to support the Venezuelan revolution. This resolution was passed with a massive 521 votes in favour. This represents 97% of the conference delegates. On the basis of this resolution the Hands Off Venezuela campaign can now officially circulate its message of solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution among the members of one of the biggest trade unions in Europe with 1.2 million members. The Chair of the conference explained that the Venezuelan question was a very important issue and it is important that the union is now taking it on board. During the 5-day conference delegates and some Brighton based supporters of the campaign collected hundreds of signatures for the “ Open letter to US trade unions ”. Importantly, among the signatories were Derek Simpson, the General Secretary of the union, as well as several members of the NEC, including Bill Spiers, Meurig Thomas, John Oliver, Steve Davison (Chair of Amicus), Dave Hutchinson, Jane Stewart, Colin Walker, Dean Taylor, Eddie Grimes and Howard Turner. Among the international visitors C.H. Venkatachalam, the General Secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ association also signed up. This decision of Amicus comes after a number of other important unions in Britain have already pledged support for the Bolivarian revolution and for the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Amongst those is the railway workers union RMT, the firefighters FBU, the transport union TGWU, the journalists union NUJ and the college lecturers union NATFHE. Now we need to build on this successful intervention at Amicus conference and reach out to more trade unions with the message of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Here we publish the text of the resolution that was passed. This Conference deplores the intents of the United States to intervene in the internal life of Venezuela. Two attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected Government of Hugo Chavez and behind these attempts has been the hand of the CIA. Conference pledges its support to the revolutionary movement of the Venezuelan people in their struggle for socialist equality and justice.

			Recent HOV activities in Germany",2005-05-24T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HOV reporters in Germany","HOV supporters in Germany have stepped up their activities in recent weeks. The recent appeal to American trade unionists has been translated and distributed at May Day rallies and other events, with many activists signing. In April, Venezuelan foreign minister Ali Rodriguez met representatives of solidarity groups in Berlin to discuss their work. Local HOV supporter Alex Dirmeier grasped the opportunity by handing over a petition to Ali Rodriguez calling for the nationalisation of the CNV valve factory. The minister gave a friendly and sympathetic response, explaining that the government was considering nationalisation (as it happened a few days later). In German HOV meetings we attach a lot of importance to the fact that with the case of CNV another important and significant nationalisation has taken place in Venezuela. Whereas in Germany and elsewhere in the world trade unionists are engaged in bitter struggles against many cases of privatisation and have lost most of these struggles, Venezuela shows that a different direction of events is possible. This serves as source of inspiration and encouragement. In Cologne, where the local HOV group holds regular public meetings, a Venezuelan student involved in the local solidarity work gave an impressive report of her recent stay in Venezuela which included visits to the nationalised Venepal (now: Invepal) factory, a meeting with president Chávez and other important events and interventions by the comrades there. In recent weeks, important sections of ['solid], the socialist youth organisation close to the PDS, have affiliated to the HOV campaign. This includes above all the federation in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's biggest state, where the regional assembly voted unanimously on the resolution moved by the Cologne branch which had already become an active part of the campaign earlier on. The resolution confirms that HOV is the most profound and internationally based solidarity campaign defending the process of the Bolivarian Revolution. ['solid] will try to organize various events to campaign in favour of the Venezuelan comrades. ['solid] truly believes that the Hands Off Venezuela campaign offers a specific socialist perspective and is a viable perspective for defending the revolutionary process, reports Timothi Maywood from Cologne who is a spokesman of ['solid] in North Rhine-Westphalia. Of course, ['solid] will work closely together with comrades from other Hands Off Venezuela comitees as well as with the official comitees preparing for the ""16th World Festival of Youth and Students"". ['solid]-North Rhine-Westphalia promised to donate 150 Euro for the international solidarity fund in order to help comrades from Namibia to take part in the Festival. Several comrades of us will also take part this August and prepare discussions on the ""possibilities and perspectives of nationalization"" and on ""youth resistance against the nazis"". ['solid] will now focus on creating HoV-comitees in different areas all over North Rhine-Westphalia with the help of its local branches and try to establish relations to the trade union and labour movement. We believe that the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign can be the making for socialist ideas among workers and youth and can serve a strong internationalist class position within the German labour movement. On May 19, Hans-Gerd Öfinger was invited to the town of Celle (Lower Saxony) to speak on the development in Venezuela and the HOV campaign in Germany. Over 40 persons, local left wing activists from different backgrounds and youth, attended the meeting and - according to the comrade who had initiated the event - were impressed with the revolutionary process as well as the analysis and non-sectarian approach to the Bolivarian movement put forward in the lead-off. Hans-Gerd emphasised the need for the German trade unions organised in the DGB to break all links with the Venezuelan CTV (which is still a section of the ICFTU) and accept the UNT as the only legitimate workers' union federation in the country. DGB chairman Michael Sommer (who is a leading figure in the ICFTU) had recently made a tour to Latin America and reported on his political talks in the DGB website. However, there is silence about what Michael Sommer did in Caracas and whom he met there. ""I have tried to get an answer to my question for a week, but unfortunately nobody in the DGB headquarters has been able to tell me what Michael Sommer did in Caracas"", Hans-Gerd criticised. With the election campaign starting in Germany, HOV will also explain the scandalous role played by German politicians in relation to Venezuela. Whereas the Social Democrats keep fiddling around with the Venezuelan opposition party AD, a liberal MP named Karl Addicks recently denounced President Chávez as a ""dangerous agitator"" who was about to lead the country into chaos and civil war. The world had to prepare for a big bushfire in Latin America, Addicks warned. This shows the frame of mind of leading bourgeois politicians in Germany who might take over government in the country if the social democrats lose in the forthcoming elections. So whatever happens there will be a lot to do for HOV in Germany. We are planning interventions in open air events and a continuation of our discussion meetings and film shows.

			Hands off Venezuela campaign launched in Vancouver!",2005-05-12T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela Vancouver","On the eve of May Day, forty people gathered at the Unitarian Church to launch the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Vancouver. Four speakers briefly addressed the meeting before the floor was opened up for discussion – both political and tactical. Well-known Vancouver City Councilor Tim Louis (from the Coalition of Progressive Electors) linked the Bolivarian revolution to the struggle for socialism in Canada. Political Science professor Peter Prontzos discussed US imperialism in Latin America past and present, and Jay Hartling reported on the recent trip of the Bolivarian Circle of Vancouver (Bob Everton) to Venezuela. Miriam Martin from Fightback and the International Hands off Venezuela campaign reviewed the gains of the revolution so far and emphasized the need for the revolution to be carried to its logical conclusion - socialism. An organizing committee was struck, and it was agreed that public events should continue monthly—including pickets, film screenings, parties with food and music, and a book launch for Alan Woods’ new book The Venezuelan Revolution - A Marxist Perspective. $100 was collected to be shared with some youth from the church’s Social Justice Committee, who will be attending the World Festival of Students and Youth this summer in Caracas. The collection also contained 35,000 Bolivars! The launch was filmed and will be aired on Global Justice television on Shaw cable 4. If you are interested in getting involved with the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Vancouver, please contact vancouver[at] handsoffvenezuela.org . On the eve of May Day, forty people gathered at the Unitarian Church to launch the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Vancouver. Four speakers briefly addressed the meeting before the floor was opened up for discussion – both political and tactical. Well-known Vancouver City Councilor Tim Louis (from the Coalition of Progressive Electors) linked the Bolivarian revolution to the struggle for socialism in Canada. Political Science professor Peter Prontzos discussed US imperialism in Latin America past and present, and Jay Hartling reported on the recent trip of the Bolivarian Circle of Vancouver (Bob Everton) to Venezuela.

			Venezuela trade union solidarity appeal launched for May Day",2005-04-29T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","A major trade union initiative in solidarity with Venezuela has been launched by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Coinciding with the celebration of International Workers' day, Hands Off Venezuela is promoting an "" Open letter to US trade unionists "". The appeal comes after the recent belligerent statements and attacks on President Chavez on the part of the representatives of the Bush Administration, which, according to Jorge Martin, HOV international secretary, ""pose a direct threat to the working people of Venezuela"". The aim of this campaign is to raise awareness within the labour movement in the United States about what is really happening in Venezuela and particularly about the threat posed by the aggressive stance of the US administration. ""Such aggressive statements from the White House are of the same kind of language that was used to prepare the ground for US intervention in Vietnam, Cuba, Chile, Iraq and elsewhere,"" said Jorge. ""The democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez has been accused of everything, from linking up with North Korea, supplying arms to the Colombian FARC guerrillas and funding the ‘subversive’ MAS in Bolivia, to forming an axis of evil with Cuba's Castro, starting an arms race in Latin America, and harbouring Al-Qaeda terrorists"" he added, ""but there is not a single shred of evidence for any of these accusations"". For this reason the campaign will be participating in May Day marches in more than 20 countries in three continents to highlight the achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela and collecting signatures of trade union activists and leaders for the ""Open Letter to US trade unionists"". ""We think that the only force that can stop intervention against Venezuela is the US labour movement, together with the youth, students and intellectuals and artists,"" Jorge explained. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has always stressed that the Bolivarian movement has nothing against the people of the US, only against the aggressive policies pursued by the Bush administration. The Hands Off Venezuela campaign, active in more than 30 countries around the world, has been campaigning to defend the Venezuelan revolution for more than two and a half years. The campaign has been publicly backed by President Chavez, and more recently by Adan Chavez, the Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba who said, ""I recognise the invaluable work of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. I appeal to you to go forward, be sure that this work will give important fruits in the end"". Orlando Chirinos, national coordinator of the UNT (National Workers Union) in Venezuela recognised the campaign as ""an extraordinary initiative. It is the only significant campaign that is taking place internationally."" In an interview with Alan Woods, who was in Venezuela attending the 3rd World Gathering in Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution, he said that he ""considers the links between the UNT and the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign as very important"". The campaign has been fighting to get recognition for the newly created UNT within the trade union movement in Europe. It was in discussions with leading figures in the Bolivarian movement and the Venezuelan trade unions during Alan Woods’ visit, that the idea of the campaign was raised. ""Revolutionary activists in Venezuela are very keen to reach ordinary working people in the US so that they can break the campaign of lies and propaganda of the mass media about what is really going on in Venezuela,"" said Alan Woods. The struggle in Venezuela is, amongst other things, against privatisation and for free health care and education for all. The labour movement in the United States surely can relate to these issues. Hands Off Venezuela has also given material and moral support to the struggle of the workers in the occupied factories in Venezuela, particularly the Venepal paper mill and the valve making CNV factory. These companies were closed down by their owners as part of the campaign of sabotage against the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez. The workers decided to occupy them, and after a long struggle the companies were expropriated and are now run under joint management of the state and the workers. At a meeting to discuss the role of the workers in the economy, which took place at the Caracas Central University (UCV), representatives of the workers in both factories thanked the Hands Off Venezuela campaign for the role played by international solidarity in their victories. You can participate in the campaign by downloading the information leaflet and the petition and using it in your area, trade union branch or university. A major trade union initiative in solidarity with Venezuela has been launched by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign.

It is the only significant campaign that is taking place internationally."" In an interview with Alan Woods, who was in Venezuela attending the 3rd World Gathering in Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution, he said that he ""considers the links between the UNT and the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign as very important"". The campaign has been fighting to get recognition for the newly created UNT within the trade union movement in Europe. It was in discussions with leading figures in the Bolivarian movement and the Venezuelan trade unions during Alan Woods’ visit, that the idea of the campaign was raised. ""Revolutionary activists in Venezuela are very keen to reach ordinary working people in the US so that they can break the campaign of lies and propaganda of the mass media about what is really going on in Venezuela,"" said Alan Woods. The struggle in Venezuela is, amongst other things, against privatisation and for free health care and education for all. The labour movement in the United States surely can relate to these issues. Hands Off Venezuela has also given material and moral support to the struggle of the workers in the occupied factories in Venezuela, particularly the Venepal paper mill and the valve making CNV factory. These companies were closed down by their owners as part of the campaign of sabotage against the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez. The workers decided to occupy them, and after a long struggle the companies were expropriated and are now run under joint management of the state and the workers. At a meeting to discuss the role of the workers in the economy, which took place at the Caracas Central University (UCV), representatives of the workers in both factories thanked the Hands Off Venezuela campaign for the role played by international solidarity in their victories. You can participate in the campaign by downloading the information leaflet and the petition and using it in your area, trade union branch or university.",NA,NA

			Hands Off Venezuela launched in Waterloo, Ontario",2005-04-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Aaron Levin","On April 4 th the Kitchener-Waterloo region saw it’s first Hands Off Venezuela event. This is just one of a series of launch meetings occurring across Canada. The movie The Revolution Will Not Be Televised was shown in the University of Waterloo Student Life Center. Despite the upcoming exam-week and problems getting posters up on campus, 40 people came to the event. A variety of people showed up including professors, graduate students, students, and even members of the Venezuelan Opposition! The event started off with a short introduction to capitalist developments in Latin America by guest speaker Alex Grant (of HOV-Toronto and Fightback). After the movie Alex spoke about the events in Venezuela after the 2002 coup with an emphasis on the 2004 referendum, the nationalization of Venepal under workers' control, the demoralization of the opposition, and Chavez’s recent turn to genuine democratic socialism. The most successful aspect of the event, however, was the lively discussion afterwards. Everyone in the crowd seemed eager to either ask questions or freely comment. The members of the opposition attempted to provide their critiques of the Bolivarian revolution (anywhere from corruption in the referendum to complaints of violations against private property), which were met with much opposition from the crowd. At one point an opposition supporter, wearing a bright pink sorority sweater and sitting in the centre of the room, tried to assert that the military coup in 2002 was actually not a coup but some other “thing”. She also disagreed that the opposition is demoralized and asserted that they will come back – at which point Alex Grant agreed with them saying, “Yes, the opposition will come back if the revolution is unable to continue to improve the standard of living for Venezuelan workers and poor. If they come back they will have their revenge on the people like Pinochet’s bloodbath in Chile. That is why the Venezuelan workers must expropriate the oligarchy to stop their ability to wage economic terrorism.” In a surprising twist, and without the guiding hand of its socialist organizers, the discussion naturally veered to a debate on Marxism, socialism, and revolution. This shows that even Canadians are aware of the great tasks ahead for the Bolivarian Revolution and what lessons Venezuela holds for Canadian workers and youth. Overall the event was a great success and plans are being made for future events at Waterloo. Contact info: This email address is being protected from spambots.

													Venezuelan Bolivarian University Press","""We will never complete the revolution as long as private property is upheld"" From the Venezuelan Bolivarian University Press Caracas , April 12, 2005 . ""If we continue to work under the thesis of reformism, it will be very difficult to create the revolutionary consciousness needed for the period of change we are living through, and we would be wasting all the effort carried out by our President Hugo Chavez Frias"". This is what William Izarra, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for Asia and the Pacific, said during an event under the title ""Socialism of the 21st Century"". He was accompanied by Alan Woods, a British intellectual of the Revolutionary Marxist Current, Dr Orietta Caponi, Rector of the Venezuelan Bolivarian University , and the Secretary General Elizabeth Alves. The meeting was held in the Simon Bolivar hall of our studies house. Izarra explained that we have entered a new stage of the process. This situation implies ideological definitions in order to take the right path between the two possibilities: reform or revolution. Reform implies the continuity of the political model of representative democracy and to continue to exercise a command model based on the fascination of power. On the other hand there is revolution, a political model based on direct democracy, which means above all, to transform power into a tool of the people. It means transferring decision making to organised communities. ""It is to rule on the basis of the right of the people to participate, to give constitutional consistency to the sovereign acts of the national collective"" said Comandante Izarra. Alan Woods, strengthening what had been said by Izarra, pointed out that the reformist behaviour is simply the expression of counter-revolution. ""This is why I say, and I insist on this, that many times a victory can be turned into a defeat if there isn't a leadership which is consistent and coherent with this period"". The British intellectual recounted the epic intervention of the Venezuelan people during the coup d'etat on April 11, 2002 , explaining how that popular uprising had no parallels anywhere in the world, and was unprecedented in any country of Latin America . Woods explained that Venezuela is living through a revolution which has only gone half way, because as long as the oligarchy exists with its economic power intact we cannot speak of a revolution as such, ""unfortunately, as long as private property is upheld, we will never have a complete revolution"". The Marxist leader ended by saying that Venezuela is at the crossroads: either we achieve the most important political and social victory in our contemporary history or we will suffer the most crushing of defeats, ""either we defeat the counter-revolution, or it will defeat us"". ""We will never complete the revolution as long as private property is upheld"" From the Venezuelan Bolivarian University Press Caracas , April 12, 2005 .

													Hands Off Venezuela","On May 7, the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign made a presentation at the 1st annual Winnipeg Social Forum, held at the University of Winnipeg in Manitoba. Joining some 60 people who had participated in a full day of presentations, workshops, discussions, musicians, food, and street theatre, the supporters of Hands Off Venezuela and Fightback participated in a lively discussion on the important issue of Venezuela. Cy Gonick of SMAC facilitated the session. John Peterson, from the U.S. HOV campaign, briefly introduced the film ""Venezuela Bolivariana"", an overview of events in Venezuela from the 1989 ""Caracazo"" uprising to the aftermath of the 2002 coup against democratically-elected President Hugo Chavez. Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, the film was cut short. Peterson picked up where the film left off, bringing the audience up to the present situation in Venezuela. Many questions were asked after his introduction, and many in the enthusiastic and attentive audience expressed an interest in forming a Winnipeg HOV committee. Peterson also informed the audience of the World Festival of Students and Youth taking place this summer in Caracas, Venezuela, and issued an appeal for trade unionists in Canada to support the latest petition of the campaign (see Open Letter to U.S. Trade Unionists) . After the event, many of those present visited the HOV / Fightback table to sign the HOV petition, pick up leaflets and other materials, ask further questions, etc. There was broad interest in the revolutionary events taking place in Venezuela, with eagerness to build solidarity and raise awareness through film showings, visits by trade unionists from Venezuela, visits to Venezuela to learn from the grassroots movement, etc. ""Winnipeg, with its history of class struggle and workers' movements is a great place to build upon the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, which I believe will play a huge role in the fight to allow the Venezuelan people self-determination free from U.S. intervention. Educating the people of the world about working, evolving alternatives to capitalism and imperialist governments is key in the struggle for a world wide workers' revolution,"" said Aly Malabar, an HOV supporter in Winnipeg. A meeting to formally launch the Winnipeg HOV committee will be announced soon. We invite you to join us in this important campaign.

													Ramon Samblas","A sizeable group of British and Latin American youth joined by other campaigners and trade unionists gathered in the Saint George’s Community Circle on April 23 rd . The reason was not to celebrate Saint George’s Day but to critically debate the struggles all across the Latin American continent with a special focus in Venezuela. The event organised by this community centre, Hands Off Venezuela Campaign and New Generation ended with a gig that lasted till the small hours. Vegetarian food was served all day by the New Generation supporters at very affordable prices. The day started with a workshop on the meaning of Bolivarianism and Socialism introduced by Jorge Martin, from the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The attendants discussed the real repercussions of both ideologies these days in the ongoing Venezuelan Revolution and what the real meanings of both terms for the Venezuelan masses are. After this interesting discussion the attendants had the chance to hear Colombia Solidarity Campaign activist Andy Higginbottom talking on the war launched by Coca-Cola on the Colombian Trade Union movement. It was hair-raising to hear how the thugs hired by this corporation have assassinated representatives of the workers inside Coca-Cola plants. Andy finished his talk by appealing to people to implement the Killer-Cola Boycott. Before lunch time Jorge Martin reported on the uprising and overthrowing of the Lucio Gutierrez government after he failed to fulfill the hopes of the masses in working and living conditions (see Ecuador: Popular uprising overthrows Lucio Gutierrez ). Around 4pm the school reached its peak with 50 people joining in the discussion conducted by Dave Raby (Institute of Latin American Studies in Liverpool) called “Transforming the Military”. Dave explained how besides the reactionary traditions of the South American military there was a progressive tradition. President Chavez and others organised clandestine military movements to overthrow the corrupt and pro-bosses governments of AD and COPEI (two main parties in Venezuela that alternated in power until they were ousted in 1998). Hugo Chavez himself got inspiration from progressive military movements in Panama and Peru. Next, different examples were given of how the Venezuelan armed forces were being used not for repressive ends, but for social ones. For instance, the Armed Forces are used to build houses and clinics in the shanty towns around Caracas. The debate was very animated and people discussed different issues, amongst them the formation of popular militias and the meaning of ""the people in arms"". When the debates finished “Venezuela from Below” was screened while New Generation held salsa lessons. Afterwards, the attendants enjoyed a gig where samba bands, DJs, folk music bands and hip hop crews performed. One of the members of one of the Venezuelan bands that performed in the concert refused to be part of the event on the basis that the School and party were fundraising events to send young people to Caracas. The social polarisation around the Venezuelan revolution goes beyond the Latin American continent, and the repercussion of its victory will also go beyond the limits of Venezuela and Latin America.

We therefore appeal to our friends in the American trade union movement to join with us in condemning these provocations and to place the maximum pressure on the Bush Administration to desist from these attacks. We demand the right of the Venezuelan people to self-determination and no to imperialist interference. (See also the letter from American workers and trade unionists to the U.S. government .)

We therefore appeal to our friends in the American trade union movement to join with us in condemning these provocations and to place the maximum pressure on the Bush Administration to desist from these attacks. We demand the right of the Venezuelan people to self-determination and no to imperialist interference. (See also the letter from American workers and trade unionists to the U.S. government .) See the signatures . The Hands Off Venezuela Campaign, which is a broad-based campaign, was established to generate awareness about Venezuela within the labour and trade union movement and young people internationally ",NA,NA

			The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela and British Workers Make Contact!",2005-04-07T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Andy Goodall - www.venezuelasolidarity.org.uk","Two Venezuelan leaders for La Victoria (one hour west of Caracas) spoke to the group in the first international Internet conference between British activists and Bolivarian revolutionaries in Venezuela. Over 30 activists from around Britain, some travelling over 80 miles, heard the Venezuelans deliver their message in Spanish through an interpreter prior to watching the film documentary, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised in a cinema in Wolverhampton. Héctor Díaz Piña spoke to the group about the role of the People of Venezuela in defending their national sovereignty. Mr. Piña has a clear understanding of the dynamics and structure of revolution due to his extensive study of revolutions around the world. He was in contact with then Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez while Chavez was in Yare penitentiary and was also in his bodyguard unit in Aragua state. This was during the period when Chavez toured the country from March 1994 forward, developing support all over the country. Carlos Ojeda provided a vision from the active membership in the trade unions. Carlos described the infrastructure of non-violent revolution and explained why Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias has such massive support by Venezuelan workers. Carlos is a local leader who helps people in communities understand and develop their roles in the Bolivarian revolution. Using the internet based software Skype, participants were able to listen to and talk with activists in Venezuela and the US. The meeting heard contributions which covered the increasing democratization of the country with massive participation of millions of people determined to make their lives better. The importance of deepening the mass participation in the process, linked with building support for the revolution across South America and worldwide, was recognized and discussed. Following the meeting, at which people asked questions of both the Venezuelan activists and Les Blough, founder of Axis of Logic in the United States, all participants stayed to see the important film documentary The Revolution will Not Be Televised. For the overwhelming majority, this was the first opportunity they had to witness the historic documentary. The particpant's enthusiastic reception and comments demonstrated proof of peoples interest in the ongoing revolution in Latin America and their anger at the illegal attempts by the US and fascist opposition to bring down the Chavez government. Those who delivered the discussion and film agreed to hold similar international events in the future. They also recognize that the role of women in the revolution in Venezuela was critical and plan to bring Venezuela's Bolivarian women present in the future. The next session of the increased solidarity work will watch the film, enter the Oil workers, which shows the magnificent role played by women in defeating the bosses lockout. The potential for using the new technology is increasing daily. With the ever increasing manipulation of the news by the big business media, novel and imaginative use of this technology will assist all workers worldwide in defending themselves and resisting lies and fascism. The next meeting using this technology is scheduled to be held in New Zealand on April 9th. The technology used will enable Venezuelans to speak with any country in the world and, bearing in mind the tough time that Bolivarian Groups are having in Miami, this would be an ideal setting to hold a future Skype conference. Any groups interested, from any country in the world in setting up an international conference of this nature, should contact the author of this piece.

													Hands Off Venezuela","  A group of about 40 activists protested outside the US embassy in London on Monday, June 13, demanding that Washington accepts the extradition request for Posada Carriles to Venezuela. Cuban-Venezuelan Luis Posada is wanted for blowing up an airliner in 1976, killing 73 people. He was arrested last month in the US, which is refusing to hand him over to Venezuela, where he escaped from jail. His partner in crime, Orlando Bosch, was given a presidential pardon by Bush the Elder and now lives in Miami, where they have named a street after him.    The protest picket, called jointly by Hands Off Venezuela, the Bolivian Solidarity Campaign and the Colombia Solidarity Campaign, also highlighted the hypocrisy of the US administration when it comes to dealing with terrorists. In Colombia this year a total of seven US soldiers (including a colonel) have been arrested for, between them, selling ammunition to right-wing paramilitaries and attempting to smuggle cocaine into the US. Before the Colombian judiciary could blink, they were whisked out of the country to prevent further embarrassment and have not yet been charged with any crime.  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used to be President of Bolivia, before he ordered the massacre of peaceful protesters in 2003 and fled to Miami to escape the furious backlash. Bolivians want him tried for crimes against humanity, but that doesn't seem likely while he's protected by the US government, who immediately granted him political asylum.

			Enthusiastic response for Marxist ideas: Successful public meetings in Caracas",2005-04-13T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Our Correspondent - www.marxist.com","On Monday April 11 and Tuesday April 12, the Revolutionary Marxist Current (CMR) organized two very successful public meetings at the Bolivarian University. In the first meeting there were five hundred people and in the second over four hundred. The audience consisted mainly of young people, students and Bolivarian activists, but in both meetings there was a fair number of workers and trade unionists. The subject of the first meeting was “Workers’ Control, Venepal Shows the Way”. The subject of the second meting was “Socialism in the 21st Century”. The speakers on Monday were Jorge Paredes, one of the leaders of the occupied factory Costructor Nacional de Valvulas, Luis Primo, of the regional executive of the UNT in Caracas and Miranda, Ricardo Galindez, a leader of the oil workers’ union in Lara and editor of the Marxist paper, Topo Obrero. The last speaker was Alan Woods, editor of Marxist.com . The response of the audience was enthusiastic, in both meetings. The speakers emphasised the need for the Bolivarian Revolution to go beyond the limits of capitalism, for the workers to follow the example of Venepal and introduce workers’ control as a step towards nationalisation and a socialist planned economy. This position was warmly applauded by those present, many of whom feel that the revolution has not gone far enough. The argument that it is necessary to combat bureaucracy and introduce control from below got a particularly keen applause. On Tuesday there were just two speakers. The first was Comandante William Izarra, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Comrade Izarra has been identified with the left wing of the Bolivarian Movement. In his speech he emphasised that so far the Revolution had carried out reforms but had not brought about a fundamental change. He likened this to pruning a tree and picking the flowers, whereas what was needed was to attack the roots. Socialism, he said, must mean that power must pass to the people. William Izarra stressed that it was impossible to carry out a revolution while the old state apparatus remained intact, all the old judges, bureaucrats and governors were an obstacle in the road of advance that must be removed. These points were greeted with wild applause and cries of “Power to the People” and “Power to the Workers”. Comrade Izarra expressed his thanks to the Revolutionary Marxist Current for inviting him and expressed the wish for the collaboration of all genuinely revolutionary forces. The second speaker, Alan Woods, was greeted with warm applause. He is already widely known for his consistent defence of the Revolution and also for his continued advocacy of socialism. Alan welcomed the declarations of Hugo Chavez that capitalism is slavery and that the Bolivarian Revolution must advance to socialism. Alan warned that the counter-revolution was not yet defeated and that it was dangerous to spread illusions. He pointed out that the motor force of the Revolution was the masses and above all the working class. He stressed that there was no way forward unless the Revolution expropriated the oligarchy and nationalised the land, the banks and the big companies under workers’ control. Those who opposed this on the grounds of so-called realism were really the worst utopians. Unless this step was taken, the correlation of class forces, which was very favourable, would inevitably change. Workers would become disappointed and fall into apathy. At that point the counter-revolution would strike. Either we smash the counter-revolutionaries, or they will smash us, he said. Alan emphasised that although the Bolivarian Revolution had its own unique personality and specific identity, it had to learn from other revolutions of the past, especially the Russian Revolution. Alan quoted Lenin’s programme of four points and showed that these were absolutely relevant to Venezuela today. The audience was particularly enthusiastic about the demand for the recall of bureaucrats and a limitation on the salaries of all functionaries. When Alan cited Lenin’s demand to arm the people, there were loud chants in favour of a people’s militia. The workers of Venezuela are ready to fight. After a lively debate in which different views were freely expressed, analysed and criticised, the meeting ended in a mood of euphoria. At the end, comrade Woods appealed to all present to help in the building of a genuine Marxist revolutionary tendency in the Bolivarian Movement, a tendency represented by the Revolutionary Marxist Current. The Current has grown rapidly in size and influence, as the success of these meetings clearly showed. The reason for this success is quite clear.

It was followed by a discussion on the developments in Venezuela since the coup, including the heroic activities of the Venepal workers. The film demonstrated the commitment to democracy that the Venezuelan Revolution represents and the negative influence the upper classes, of all countries, have ha on human freedom. As well it helped illustrate the need to not only support the Revolution, but to spread it other countries across the globe. The campus of small Trent University, located in the industrial town of Peterborough, Ontario, has been alive with discussion on Latin America in the last few weeks. Numerous articles have appeared in the student newspaper encompassing issues from Cuban solidarity to the Zapitizta Rebellion. But the most important issue of the day has been Venezuela and the Bolivarian Revolution. Many students, who previously had lacked any idea of the situation in Venezuela, have begun passionately advocating the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. A recent student newspaper article called for international support for the Venezuelan Revolution. Another referred to Chavez and Venezuela as “an inspiration”. The work of the Hand off Venezuela campaign will continue to work hard in the interests of democracy and solidarity at Trent and increase the Revolutionary movement that has already gained significant support in student politics.

Signed.......................... Workers of the Constructora Nacional de Valvulas (National Manufacturer of Valves) Los Teques, Miranda State, in Venezuela, have not received their salaries for two years and three months. After having come into conflict with Andrés Sosa Pietri (the owner of the factory), one of the industrialists that was involved in the April 2002 coup, the factory was closed. After the nationalisation of Venepal, these workers, who had already occupied the Constructora Nacional de Valvulas for several months a year ago, have occupied it again and are demanding that it also be nationalised.

Dear Sisters and Brothers: We in Venezuela have been part of the effort by the working class to create a trade union federation that is built from the bottom up by the rank and file and that is rooted in the principles of class independence, trade union democracy and full autonomy in relation to the State and all political parties. This effort – which in April 2003 brought unionists from different sectors and trade union currents together to create the UNT – is part and parcel of the struggle of our people in defense of their national sovereignty. Today, the UNT represents the majority of the organized workforce in Venezuela. Its creation in 2003 has given a huge impetus to the drive to organize trade unions across our country. The rate of trade union affiliation has increased from 11% in 2001 to 23% in 2004. The UNT also has been present in the last two International Labor Conferences of the ILO in June 2003 and June 2004. But these recent years also have seen FEDECAMARAS, the employers’ association of Venezuela, join forces with the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV) to present a Complaint to the ILO’s Committee on Freedom of Association alleging that the Venezuelan government has violated Trade Union Freedoms and the Right to Strike. The joint Complaint by FEDECAMARAS and the CTV is highly unusual, as trade unions are generally the ones filing ILO Complaints against the employers and seeking support from the ILO Workers’ Group against all violations of trade union rights, including the right to strike. It is unprecedented, as well, on account of the convergence of interests between FEDECAMARAS and the CTV. Such a Complaint can be understood only in the context of the unfolding political situation in Venezuela, in which FEDECAMARAS and the top leadership of the CTV participated directly in the attempted military coup of April 2002, together with the opposition political parties and with the encouragement of the U.S. Embassy. The coup – which established a government” headed by Pedro Carmona, then president of FEDECAMARAS – was foiled after just two days by the mass mobilizations of the Venezuelan workers and people. Later, in December 2002 and January 2003, FEDECAMARAS – together with the same leaders of the CTV – organized an employer lockout/work stoppage that was political in nature and that sought to bring down the government through the sabotage of the country’s main source of income: the oil industry. In both the attempted coup and the bosses’ lockout/work stoppage, the CTV leadership took actions that were repudiated by the overwhelming majority of the workers of Venezuela. At no time, in fact, were the workers consulted by the CTV leadership about the work stoppage in the oil industry. Quite the contrary, upon learning of this action by the CTV leadership, the workers mobilized massively to occupy the oil rigs and refineries to ensure the resumption of oil production. These undeniable facts were reported in detail by 35 leaders of the UNT to the Contact Mission of the ILO that traveled to Venezuela in October 2004. It is not new, nor is it unexpected, that employers should resort to lockouts against the workers to promote their interests. Many of you undoubtedly have witnessed such bosses’ lockouts in your countries. It is less frequent for the employers to resort to military coups, but, alas, such actions are not unprecedented. But isn’t it an insult to our intelligence to try to have us believe that employer lockouts and military coups can somehow be aimed at defending democracy and trade union rights? Do they think we’re fools who cannot see through their hypocrisy? In June 2004, FEDECAMARAS – with the full support of the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and representatives from bosses’ organizations in 22 countries, including the United States, all of them notorious for their anti-union activities – invoked Article 26 of the ILO Constitution and proposed that a Commission of Inquiry be established in relation to alleged violations of Trade Union Freedoms in Venezuela. The March 8-24, 2005 meeting of the Governing Body of the ILO is scheduled to take a vote on this request by FEDECAMARAS. It is worth noting that while this baseless Complaint against the Venezuelan government moves through the ILO system, the government of Colombia has not been subjected to any sanctions or pressures by the ILO – even when the ILO itself registered at the beginning of 2004 that 186 trade unionists had been assassinated for their union activity in that country, a number that now surpasses the 200 mark. Dear Sisters and Brothers: The Venezuelan government today has wide popular support to advance its Agrarian Reform program and, with the aim of guaranteeing jobs and wages, to take over factories abandoned or bankrupted by their employers. Yet at this very moment, incidents are being staged to create a diplomatic conflict between Venezuela and Colombia. More ominous still, U.S. President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have issued public warnings against the alleged “negative” and “destabilizing” role of Venezuela in the region. Anyone familiar with the international policies implemented by the Bush administration in the recent period can understand full well that these are not simply words; they are a direct threat to Venezuela. Bush and Rice invoke the concept of “democracy” – but if one looks at what is going on in Iraq today, one can see what they mean by “democracy.” Is it possible not to see a link between these political developments and the stance taken by FEDECAMARAS at the ILO? Regardless of what one’s opinions may be about the Venezuelan government and its policies, it’s a fact that it’s a government that received the support of more than 60% of the people in the August 15, 2004 recall referendum, thereby dealing a blow to the effort by FEDECAMARAS and the top officials of the CTV to oust the Chávez government. The election results were ratified, in fact, by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Carter Center, two bodies that cannot be accused of harboring any sympathies for the Venezuelan government. It is also an undeniable fact that the partisans of the current Venezuelan government obtained the overwhelming support of the people in the state and regional elections held in October 2004. From our vantage point as the UNT, genuine democracy means respecting the sovereign will of people to determine their own fate. And we wish to reiterate this point: Venezuela’s right to self-determination must be respected and upheld independent of whatever one may think about the current government of Venezuela. It is not up to the U.S. government to decide in the place of the Venezuelan people what is “positive” or “negative” for Venezuela. It is totally understandable that the representatives of the employers in the ILO should form a common front with FEDECAMARAS in support of this Complaint. Likewise, it is not surprising that governments, particularly that of Bush in the United States, should follow suit. But in no way can the representatives of the workers’ organizations in the ILO support this attack upon our sovereignty and our independent trade union organizations. Is it not obvious that allowing the Commission of Inquiry to be approved – as FEDECAMARAS demands – would, in fact, be tantamount to trampling upon our trade union freedoms and the very sovereignty of our country? Only we, the workers of Venezuela, can and must decide what kind of trade union organizations we should build, in the framework of the principles of Trade Union Freedom. We issue this urgent appeal to all trade union organizations the world over. We call upon one and all to reject the proposal by FEDECAMARAS and its cohorts to sanction Venezuela and to conduct an ILO Commission of Inquiry. Such an action is not called for, nor does it correspond to the real situation of trade union freedoms in Venezuela, which is a country that has ratified ILO Conventions 87 and 98. For our part, as trade union officers who are committed to the rank and file, we have nothing to hide. That is why we are appending to this Open Letter a Memorandum that responds to the specific charges contained in the Complaint filed by FEDECAMARAS and the CTV. We invite trade unions from all around the world to come to Venezuela to see for yourselves the reality of our country, where even the CTV – which participated directly in the attempted coup of April 2002 and the lockout/work stoppage of December 2002-January 2003, enjoys full trade union freedoms. We also invite representatives of the international trade union movement to attend the upcoming National Congress of the UNT. This will permit you to learn firsthand from the workers about the real situation of the trade unions in Venezuela. To conclude, we call upon all trade union organizations and officers to reject the provocation by FEDECAMARAS and its allies to establish an ILO Commission of Inquiry for Venezuela. We call upon you to add your names in support of this Open Letter to the ILO Workers’ Group. - In defense of the sovereignty of the Venezuelan people! - In defense of true Trade Union Freedoms!

Dear Sisters and Brothers: We in Venezuela have been part of the effort by the working class to create a trade union federation that is built from the bottom up by the rank and file and that is rooted in the principles of class independence, trade union democracy and full autonomy in relation to the State and all political parties. This effort – which in April 2003 brought unionists from different sectors and trade union currents together to create the UNT – is part and parcel of the struggle of our people in defense of their national sovereignty. Today, the UNT represents the majority of the organized workforce in Venezuela. Its creation in 2003 has given a huge impetus to the drive to organize trade unions across our country. The rate of trade union affiliation has increased from 11% in 2001 to 23% in 2004. The UNT also has been present in the last two International Labor Conferences of the ILO in June 2003 and June 2004. But these recent years also have seen FEDECAMARAS, the employers’ association of Venezuela, join forces with the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV) to present a Complaint to the ILO’s Committee on Freedom of Association alleging that the Venezuelan government has violated Trade Union Freedoms and the Right to Strike. The joint Complaint by FEDECAMARAS and the CTV is highly unusual, as trade unions are generally the ones filing ILO Complaints against the employers and seeking support from the ILO Workers’ Group against all violations of trade union rights, including the right to strike. It is unprecedented, as well, on account of the convergence of interests between FEDECAMARAS and the CTV. Such a Complaint can be understood only in the context of the unfolding political situation in Venezuela, in which FEDECAMARAS and the top leadership of the CTV participated directly in the attempted military coup of April 2002, together with the opposition political parties and with the encouragement of the U.S. Embassy. The coup – which established a government” headed by Pedro Carmona, then president of FEDECAMARAS – was foiled after just two days by the mass mobilizations of the Venezuelan workers and people. Later, in December 2002 and January 2003, FEDECAMARAS – together with the same leaders of the CTV – organized an employer lockout/work stoppage that was political in nature and that sought to bring down the government through the sabotage of the country’s main source of income: the oil industry. In both the attempted coup and the bosses’ lockout/work stoppage, the CTV leadership took actions that were repudiated by the overwhelming majority of the workers of Venezuela. At no time, in fact, were the workers consulted by the CTV leadership about the work stoppage in the oil industry. Quite the contrary, upon learning of this action by the CTV leadership, the workers mobilized massively to occupy the oil rigs and refineries to ensure the resumption of oil production. These undeniable facts were reported in detail by 35 leaders of the UNT to the Contact Mission of the ILO that traveled to Venezuela in October 2004. It is not new, nor is it unexpected, that employers should resort to lockouts against the workers to promote their interests. Many of you undoubtedly have witnessed such bosses’ lockouts in your countries. It is less frequent for the employers to resort to military coups, but, alas, such actions are not unprecedented. But isn’t it an insult to our intelligence to try to have us believe that employer lockouts and military coups can somehow be aimed at defending democracy and trade union rights? Do they think we’re fools who cannot see through their hypocrisy? In June 2004, FEDECAMARAS – with the full support of the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and representatives from bosses’ organizations in 22 countries, including the United States, all of them notorious for their anti-union activities – invoked Article 26 of the ILO Constitution and proposed that a Commission of Inquiry be established in relation to alleged violations of Trade Union Freedoms in Venezuela. The March 8-24, 2005 meeting of the Governing Body of the ILO is scheduled to take a vote on this request by FEDECAMARAS. It is worth noting that while this baseless Complaint against the Venezuelan government moves through the ILO system, the government of Colombia has not been subjected to any sanctions or pressures by the ILO – even when the ILO itself registered at the beginning of 2004 that 186 trade unionists had been assassinated for their union activity in that country, a number that now surpasses the 200 mark. Dear Sisters and Brothers: The Venezuelan government today has wide popular support to advance its Agrarian Reform program and, with the aim of guaranteeing jobs and wages, to take over factories abandoned or bankrupted by their employers. Yet at this very moment, incidents are being staged to create a diplomatic conflict between Venezuela and Colombia. More ominous still, U.S. President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have issued public warnings against the alleged “negative” and “destabilizing” role of Venezuela in the region. Anyone familiar with the international policies implemented by the Bush administration in the recent period can understand full well that these are not simply words; they are a direct threat to Venezuela. Bush and Rice invoke the concept of “democracy” – but if one looks at what is going on in Iraq today, one can see what they mean by “democracy.” Is it possible not to see a link between these political developments and the stance taken by FEDECAMARAS at the ILO? Regardless of what one’s opinions may be about the Venezuelan government and its policies, it’s a fact that it’s a government that received the support of more than 60% of the people in the August 15, 2004 recall referendum, thereby dealing a blow to the effort by FEDECAMARAS and the top officials of the CTV to oust the Chávez government. The election results were ratified, in fact, by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Carter Center, two bodies that cannot be accused of harboring any sympathies for the Venezuelan government. It is also an undeniable fact that the partisans of the current Venezuelan government obtained the overwhelming support of the people in the state and regional elections held in October 2004. From our vantage point as the UNT, genuine democracy means respecting the sovereign will of people to determine their own fate. And we wish to reiterate this point: Venezuela’s right to self-determination must be respected and upheld independent of whatever one may think about the current government of Venezuela. It is not up to the U.S. government to decide in the place of the Venezuelan people what is “positive” or “negative” for Venezuela. It is totally understandable that the representatives of the employers in the ILO should form a common front with FEDECAMARAS in support of this Complaint. Likewise, it is not surprising that governments, particularly that of Bush in the United States, should follow suit. But in no way can the representatives of the workers’ organizations in the ILO support this attack upon our sovereignty and our independent trade union organizations. Is it not obvious that allowing the Commission of Inquiry to be approved – as FEDECAMARAS demands – would, in fact, be tantamount to trampling upon our trade union freedoms and the very sovereignty of our country? Only we, the workers of Venezuela, can and must decide what kind of trade union organizations we should build, in the framework of the principles of Trade Union Freedom. We issue this urgent appeal to all trade union organizations the world over. We call upon one and all to reject the proposal by FEDECAMARAS and its cohorts to sanction Venezuela and to conduct an ILO Commission of Inquiry. Such an action is not called for, nor does it correspond to the real situation of trade union freedoms in Venezuela, which is a country that has ratified ILO Conventions 87 and 98. For our part, as trade union officers who are committed to the rank and file, we have nothing to hide. That is why we are appending to this Open Letter a Memorandum that responds to the specific charges contained in the Complaint filed by FEDECAMARAS and the CTV. We invite trade unions from all around the world to come to Venezuela to see for yourselves the reality of our country, where even the CTV – which participated directly in the attempted coup of April 2002 and the lockout/work stoppage of December 2002-January 2003, enjoys full trade union freedoms. We also invite representatives of the international trade union movement to attend the upcoming National Congress of the UNT. This will permit you to learn firsthand from the workers about the real situation of the trade unions in Venezuela. To conclude, we call upon all trade union organizations and officers to reject the provocation by FEDECAMARAS and its allies to establish an ILO Commission of Inquiry for Venezuela. We call upon you to add your names in support of this Open Letter to the ILO Workers’ Group. - In defense of the sovereignty of the Venezuelan people! - In defense of true Trade Union Freedoms! In solidarity, signed by following National Coordinators of the UNT: Orlando Chirino, Marcela Máspero, Stalin Pérez Borges and Rubén Linares",NA,NA

			Successful Hands off Venezuela meeting after anti-war demo",2005-03-21T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","The London Hands off Venezuela campaign held an excellent meeting at the Walkers of Whitehall pub just off Trafalgar Square after the anti-war demonstration on March 19, 2005. Hands off Venezuela had a stall at the demonstration that attracted a lot of attention, where DVDs, pamphlets and leaflets were distributed on the revolutionary events in Venezuela. There was a bit of a problem with the original venue for the meeting. The pub had double-booked their function room and was packed due to the rugby matches that day. We nearly cancelled the meeting when at the last minute we found the Walkers pub that agreed to allow us to host our meeting from 5:30 until 7:30. Even with the problems and the quick change of venue some 60 people turned up to the pub after the demo for the meeting. Scandalously the meeting was disrupted just five minutes after it began by the Metropolitan Police, who entered the pub and demanded that the meeting be disbanded. The manager of the pub came downstairs to the meeting and informed us that we had to vacate the premises immediately because the police had arrived demanding that we leave. Some members of the Hands off Venezuela campaign asked if we could speak to the police and clarify the issue. The police clearly believed that we were holding some sort of “subversive” meeting planning some sort of violent action. We wanted to clarify that we were holding a peaceful meeting, and that it was our democratic right to do so. When members of the campaign got upstairs to speak to the police, they discovered that they had already left. We explained to the manager of the pub that we were holding a peaceful meeting and that there would be no trouble. He then agreed to allow us to continue our meeting, but that we would have to leave the pub by 7:00. It is an absolute scandal that our meeting was disrupted and truncated by the Metropolitan Police. This issue will be raised with MPs and a formal complaint will be made against the Metropolitan Police. When the meeting got back under way David Raby (Institute of Latin American Studies, Liverpool) spoke about the significance of the Venezuelan revolution in Latin America and around the world. He pointed out that many on the left had failed to recognise that there was a revolution taking place in Venezuela because it did not fit into any historic mould, but now that Chavez had spoken about the necessity of socialism as the way forward for the revolution, many had woken up to the reality of the Bolivarian movement. He explained that what was taking place in Venezuela was a genuine revolution because of the participation of the masses in the political and economic life of the country and because the masses had taken their own destinies into their hands. This was seen in the recall referendum in August of last year with the organisation of the Electoral Battle Units (UBEs) where one million people were mobilised for the election. He mentioned that Allende in Chile didn’t even have that kind of support for his electoral success and never had a clear majority, unlike Chavez who has won nine elections with a clear majority. Another one of the major failings in Chile was that Allende was unable (or didn't really try) to transform the Armed Forces, whereas Chavez did and this was crucial. Chavez was able to generate a revolutionary movement within the military which transformed their consciousness and led to the majority of them (including some high-ranking officers) accepting their role as ""the people in uniform"". He spoke of the dangers facing the revolution and the threats of imperialism, and agreed with President Chavez that the only way forward for the revolution was socialism. He pointed out that the nationalisations taking place and Chavez’s willingness to mobilise the masses would go a long way in defending the revolution, pointing out that this is one of the failures of previous movements in Chile and Nicaragua. His other key point was that the Left needs to learn from this experience that the revolutionary vanguard cannot be decreed or proclaimed by a group of well-intentioned people who adopt Marxist ideology and organise a party, if that party is not recognised by the masses; and that the vanguard may appear in very unexpected forms, which is what occurred with Chavez and the MBR-200. Ramon Samblas, Secretary of the British Hands off Venezuela Campaign then spoke on the achievements of the revolution in Venezuela. He explained the importance of the victory of the masses against the attempted coup in April 2002, and the victory over the bosses in the oil lockout of 2002/2003. He mentioned the importance of the new social programs for literacy and healthcare, and explained the struggle of the peasants for land reform. He explained that perhaps one of the most important developments in the revolution was the nationalisation of Venepal under workers’ control. He finished by saying that the Venezuelan revolution would have major implications for the whole world, and in particular for Cuba and that one of the most important things we could do in the UK would be to join the Hands off Venezuela campaign and take part in defending the Venezuelan revolution. Heiko Koo, a Hands off Venezuela activist who has recently been to Venezuela, spoke about the politicisation of the masses. He explained that while people in the UK and most other Western countries were talking about football, the masses in Venezuela were talking about politics. He explained that when walking down the street or when in bars and cafes one can hear people speaking about events in Venezuela and around the world, about the law, and about history. This was because the masses had been awakened to struggle and the masses have understood the importance of these things to their daily lives. He explained that one good example of this was the field of mass communications, where everywhere there are local, independent radio and television stations being opened under the control of the masses and the communities they are based in. He pointed out that nearly everybody has potential access to the media, including school children who are involved in making a weekly educational programme on state television! He contrasted this with the situation in the UK, where technology should allow nearly everyone access to the media, yet in London, there is only one station where people can have some limited access. Heiko then said that this broad access to the media in Venezuela has improved people’s understanding of history. Documentaries on the history of struggle in Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua are regularly shown on television. This has led to widespread debate in the Bolivarian movement because people can see the parallels between events in Venezuela today and events in past. Heiko then connected the struggle in Venezuela and the anti-war movement by explaining that all anti-imperialist struggles must be seen as part of the wider struggle against imperialism itself. He explained that it was vitally important to be involved in the anti-war movement and against imperialist aggression in Iraq, but that similar things were being planned for Venezuela. He added that the US and the Venezuelan oligarchy had organised the coup in April 2002 in order to secure Venezuelan oil before the Iraq war and to stop the spreading of the revolution. None of the arguments used as excuses for the invasion of Iraq could be used in Venezuela because in Venezuela there is no dictator or any WMD. Chavez has been elected or won elections 9 times since 1998, and Venezuela is the most democratic country on earth, where not only do the masses have the right to recall any elected official but also the right to recall the President. He explained that there were plans by the US to assassinate Chavez and plans to provoke conflict between Colombia and Venezuela. After the speakers there was a lively debate and discussion. Many people commented on the rottenness of the Blair government and the need to reclaim the Labour Party. Others spoke on the hypocrisy of imperialism and the lies being spread around the globe about the situation in Iraq and Venezuela and the necessity of defeating imperialism and capitalism both at home and abroad. There were several contributions on the importance of Chavez’s announcement on the necessity of socialism, saying that this was the only way forward, and was an inspiring step for the masses of Latin America and the whole world. .

			Successful Launch of Hands Off Venezuela in Toronto",2005-03-24T00:00:00Z,NA,"Following the anti-war demonstration this past weekend, over a dozen people showed up at a downtown pub to launch the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Toronto. Although there were some logistical problems in arranging the event, there was a good turnout of people interested in getting actively involved in co-coordinating the HoV campaign. Some of the participants did not know much about the events happening in Venezuela but were interested in the fact that Venezuela has been successful in opposing US, European, and Canadian imperialism. A member of Fightback introduced the Hands off Venezuela campaign, and in particular, highlighted the success of HoV in Europe and Pakistan. As well, he mentioned the role that HoV played in garnering support for the nationalization of the Venepal paper mill. An HoV co-coordinating committee was elected and is to meet to plan the first HoV event in Toronto. Hands off Venezuela aims to build solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution, and prevent the international isolation of Venezuela by dispelling the lies put out by the bourgeois press. More importantly, Hands off Venezuela intends to reach out to workers and youth and inform them of what is going on in Venezuela. There, workers, youth, peasants, and the poor have begun to take control of their lives. There is no reason why the workers and youth of Canada cannot do the same!

Following the anti-war demonstration this past weekend, over a dozen people showed up at a downtown pub to launch the Hands off Venezuela campaign in Toronto. Although there were some logistical problems in arranging the event, there was a good turnout of people interested in getting actively involved in co-coordinating the HoV campaign. Some of the participants did not know much about the events happening in Venezuela but were interested in the fact that Venezuela has been successful in opposing US, European, and Canadian imperialism. A member of Fightback introduced the Hands off Venezuela campaign, and in particular, highlighted the success of HoV in Europe and Pakistan. As well, he mentioned the role that HoV played in garnering support for the nationalization of the Venepal paper mill. An HoV co-coordinating committee was elected and is to meet to plan the first HoV event in Toronto. Hands off Venezuela aims to build solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution, and prevent the international isolation of Venezuela by dispelling the lies put out by the bourgeois press. More importantly, Hands off Venezuela intends to reach out to workers and youth and inform them of what is going on in Venezuela. There, workers, youth, peasants, and the poor have begun to take control of their lives. There is no reason why the workers and youth of Canada cannot do the same!

													our correspondent","The combat against militarisation and dismantling of the welfare state as well as strict opposition to the new EU draft constitution were the main topics hammered home at this year’s Easter marches in Germany which are traditionally organised by the peace movement. At the regional demo held in Mainz, Hans-Gerd Öfinger of Der Funke and Hands off Venezuela was one of the speakers. He emphasised the fact that while the movement in Germany deplored recent developments and trends in Europe, the revolutionary process in Venezuela points to the way forward. This “alternative programme” in Venezuela can be seen in different aspects: Yet not only politicians in Washington D.C. but also representatives of the European and German ruling class such as the German Christian Democratic “Konrad Adenauer Foundation” and the parliamentary group of the German Free Democrats (Liberals) have confessed to be bitter enemies of the Venezuelan revolution and sympathisers of the counter-revolutionary forces. Although the Venezuelan revolution has only begun and still has its deficiencies and shortcomings, a fundamental solidarity is required. Hans-Gerd called upon the demonstrators to support the revolutionary process in Venezuela, sign the HOV petition and spread the news wherever possible to break through the barrier of silence and distortion in the German media.

			Recent HOV activities in Germany",2005-03-04T00:00:00Z,NA,"HOV supporters in Germany have been quite busy in the last few weeks. Yet this is not the end but only the beginning of our solidarity campaign. In cooperation with the Venezuelan Consul General in Frankfurt, we organised two public meetings with Dr. Luis Britto Garcia, writer and media expert who spoke on the revolutionary process in Venezuela and the role of the media. Although the two meetings in mid-February - in Wiesbaden and Cologne - were organised at a short notice, they attracted some 20 visitors each who were very keen to listen and ask questions on the current events in Venezuela. Cologne HOV meetings On Thursday, 10th and on Monday, 14th February the first 2 of in total 3 meetings on Venezuela and her Bolivarian Revolution were held in Cologne. The Cologne branch of ['solid] - the socialist youth and the Young Socialist University Group Cologne, who both have been supporting the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign for almost a year now, have organised the series which is based on three films about revolutionary Venezuela - ""Venezuela - Another Way is Possible"", ""The Revolution will not be televised"" and ""Venezuela from below"". The last event will take place approximately in early April. Each of the movies conveys a clear impression of what is really taking place inside the country, how the fronts between the working class, the small peasants and the urban poor on the one side and the oligarchy, national private media, finance capital and world imperialism on the other side are set and how the struggle for Venezuela's future is about to proceed. In addition to the movie ""Venezuela - Another Way is Possible"", which has been presented on Thursday and which provides a detailed account of the origins of the Bolivarian process, we invited Hans-Gerd Öfinger, a journalist, trade-unionist and editor of the German marxist journal Der Funke, to speak on the perspectives of the revolution. A socialist revolution or no successful revolution at all The revolutionary process in Venezuela finds itself in a critical stage. Historical developments cannot come to a standstill. The Venezuelan masses urge for a solution of their enormous social problems, for satisfaction of their needs and therefore pressurize the government of Hugo Chavez to go forward in their interests. But any improvement of the living standards of the masses questions the political, economic and social position of the oligarchy. The Venezuelan bourgeoisie, which is bound to imperialism by thousands of economic and political bonds, will not tolerate any loss of influence or fundamental change in the distribution of the national income and will continue to respond with sabotage, terrorism and military coups d'êtat to the construction of a society in the interest of the people by the Venezuelan working class and the Chavez government. As long as the economic instruments of the oligarchy, the banks, the big media corporations, the industry and the major parts of the national land, remain in the hands of reaction and private capitalists, all achievements of the Bolivarian movement are in immediate danger and any progressive development of Venezuela and the whole of Latin America in the name of the workers, peasants and the youth will not be possible. Hans-Gerd Öfinger explained that, in this context, our attention has to be focussed on the decisive battles in Venezuela - the struggle of the workers for control of production and political decisions. With the nationalisation of Venepal, a key paper and packages manufacturer in Venezuela, under workers control in January 2005 in response to the demands of the workers, which have been firmly supported internationally by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, and the decision of the former company owners to close down production, an example is given. Venepal shows how to take the revolution forward is relevant to all those spheres of the national economy which are essential for the Venezuelan people and which are used by the right wing opposition to systematically disrupt the movement. The model of Venepal now has to be extended, and the new left wing trade-union confederation, UNT, which has the potential power to achieve this goal, needs our international solidarity. Hans-Gerd Öfinger remarked that the Venezuelan counter-revolution has her allies, not only within the Bush administration, but also among European capitalists and ruling classes. Even though a direct intervention by US-Imperialism might not be on the order of today and even though the Opposition appears to be in a ""crisis"" with loss of social backing and public presence, we must not think that now there will be a gradual development and that the ruling class will ever give up peacefully and quietly. This assumption was nurtured by a recent statement made by a liberal MP in Germany who had strongly criticised President Chavez´ left wing speech delivered at the WSF where he referred to socialism. This German Liberal had referred to Venezuela as the coming ""source"" of a Latin American fire, thus demonstrating und justifying plans for further aggression against the Chavez government. Hans-Gerd hammered home the need to show concrete solidarity with the revolutionaries in Venezuela on all levels - in schools, universities, workplaces and trade-unions. The first event was attented by about 25 people and the discussion following the speech lasted for more than an hour until well after 11 p.m. One of the guests present compared the situation in Venezuela with the events during the ""Kapp-Putsch"" in Germany. In 1920, after the biggest revolutionary tides of 1918/1919, parts of the German ruling class together with loyal right-wing elements among the German military high command tried to cleanse the country from the last still existing soviets and forms of workers' power, which had been installed by workers and soldiers during the 1918 revolution, and replace them with a brutal military dictatorship. To fight back against this military coup, probably the biggest general strike in German labour history was proclaimed, which eventually turned into a revolutionary uprising and put power in the hands of the workers in some areas such as the Ruhr. In fact, this strike was even lead by ADGB (union federation) leader Carl Legien, a former supporter of the reformist right wing of the SPD and of revisionist Eduard Bernstein. In the cause of the events, he was pushed to go further than he actually intended to. The German revolution of 1920 finally suffered a terrible defeat as the Social Democracy tried to ""mediate"" and ""reconcile"" between the classes and seeked a compromise with the right wing and the leaders of the coup. When they succeeded in convincing the workers to give back their arms, the bloodbath started as reactionary soldiers and fascist elements killed hundreds of worker activists in the Ruhr. . ""The Process has to be radicalised."" On Monday, 14th February, the second meeting in Cologne took place with again with more than 20 people attending, including Cesar Méndez, Venezuelan Consul General in Frankfurt (Germany). The classic film ""The Revolution will not be televised"" gave a direct insight into the counter-revolutionary actions of April, 11th 2002 and magnificently conveyed the spirit of a people that spontaineously rises up against a criminal coup. Dr. Luis Britto Gárcia, scientist and writer whose latest publication focusses on the Venezuelan media, spoke on the disgraceful role of the big private media corporations within the revolutionary process. The Venezuelan oligarchy uses her monopoly of information and culture, as is the fact with the control of the industry, to spread lies and misinformation about the Chavez government and to inhibit any form of cultural development of the people. Especially the private media show the parasitic character of the Venezuelan bourgeoisie which is completely incapable of playing any sort of ""progressive"" role, but instead only serves her own interest in profits and the greed of imperialism. Dr. Luis Britto Gárcia remarked that Venezuela shows the way how to break the chains of neoliberalism and monopolies. During the Bolivarian Revolution, many forms of alternative media have been created by the people itself. But he also stressed that the problems of Venezuela have not yet been solved, the decisive battles have not yet been won, but just begun. The example of Venepal shows how a solution has to look like. To answer the question of perspectives for the Bolivarian movement in the words of Dr. Luis Britto Gárcia: ""The process has to be radicalised."" Hands off Venezuela, Mr. Bush! HOV supporters in Wiesbaden, Mainz and Frankfurt used the demos against the recent visit by US President Bush in the area to get the HOV campaign known locally and nationally. On February 22, an after-work demo with some 1000 participants took place in the city of Wiesbaden where GW Bush was to visit US Army soldiers on the following day. On this occasion, Hans-Gerd Öfinger, an organiser of the demo and a local union activist, linked the opposition to Bush with the question of Venezuela, pointing out that the Bush administration had supported and organised the coup in 2002 and would continue to do their utmost to bring down Chávez and stop the revolutionary process. This reference to Venezuela also found an echo in the local press which quoted from the speech. Hundreds of leaflets were distributed and many signatures collected on the spot. Another public meeting on Venezuela in Wiesbaden is scheduled for March 9 and will take in a left wing Turkish workers club. On February 23, we had a stall at the big national anti Bush demo in Mainz where Bush met chancellor Schröder on the same day. Again, many leaflets were distributed and signatures collected. One of the signers was Tobias Pflüger, a Euro MP and prominent anti-militarist who had been elected on the PDS slate. Earlier last month, an HOV representative had also been invited to speak at the regional conference of in Bavaria. In Frankfurt, HOV activists continue to meet on a monthly basis. 2005 will be a busy year for HOV activists in Germany as we are planning interventions in big rallies and festivals as well as a series of discussion meetings. Of course, we never forget our tasks in Germany itself but always link the issue of the Venezuelan revolution to the burning problems facing us at home. Step up solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution now and join the Hands Off Venezuela campaign! Long live the Venezuelan and world Revolution! Forward to Socialism! By Thomas Gamstätter, secretary of Cologne Hands Off Venezuela. HOV supporters in Germany have been quite busy in the last few weeks. Yet this is not the end but only the beginning of our solidarity campaign. In cooperation with the Venezuelan Consul General in Frankfurt, we organised two public meetings with Dr. Luis Britto Garcia, writer and media expert who spoke on the revolutionary process in Venezuela and the role of the media. Although the two meetings in mid-February - in Wiesbaden and Cologne - were organised at a short notice, they attracted some 20 visitors each who were very keen to listen and ask questions on the current events in Venezuela. Cologne HOV meetings On Thursday, 10th and on Monday, 14th February the first 2 of in total 3 meetings on Venezuela and her Bolivarian Revolution were held in Cologne. The Cologne branch of ['solid] - the socialist youth and the Young Socialist University Group Cologne, who both have been supporting the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign for almost a year now, have organised the series which is based on three films about revolutionary Venezuela - ""Venezuela - Another Way is Possible"", ""The Revolution will not be televised"" and ""Venezuela from below"". The last event will take place approximately in early April. Each of the movies conveys a clear impression of what is really taking place inside the country, how the fronts between the working class, the small peasants and the urban poor on the one side and the oligarchy, national private media, finance capital and world imperialism on the other side are set and how the struggle for Venezuela's future is about to proceed. In addition to the movie ""Venezuela - Another Way is Possible"", which has been presented on Thursday and which provides a detailed account of the origins of the Bolivarian process, we invited Hans-Gerd Öfinger, a journalist, trade-unionist and editor of the German marxist journal Der Funke, to speak on the perspectives of the revolution. A socialist revolution or no successful revolution at all The revolutionary process in Venezuela finds itself in a critical stage. Historical developments cannot come to a standstill. The Venezuelan masses urge for a solution of their enormous social problems, for satisfaction of their needs and therefore pressurize the government of Hugo Chavez to go forward in their interests. But any improvement of the living standards of the masses questions the political, economic and social position of the oligarchy. The Venezuelan bourgeoisie, which is bound to imperialism by thousands of economic and political bonds, will not tolerate any loss of influence or fundamental change in the distribution of the national income and will continue to respond with sabotage, terrorism and military coups d'êtat to the construction of a society in the interest of the people by the Venezuelan working class and the Chavez government. As long as the economic instruments of the oligarchy, the banks, the big media corporations, the industry and the major parts of the national land, remain in the hands of reaction and private capitalists, all achievements of the Bolivarian movement are in immediate danger and any progressive development of Venezuela and the whole of Latin America in the name of the workers, peasants and the youth will not be possible. Hans-Gerd Öfinger explained that, in this context, our attention has to be focussed on the decisive battles in Venezuela - the struggle of the workers for control of production and political decisions. With the nationalisation of Venepal, a key paper and packages manufacturer in Venezuela, under workers control in January 2005 in response to the demands of the workers, which have been firmly supported internationally by the Hands Off Venezuela campaign, and the decision of the former company owners to close down production, an example is given. Venepal shows how to take the revolution forward is relevant to all those spheres of the national economy which are essential for the Venezuelan people and which are used by the right wing opposition to systematically disrupt the movement. The model of Venepal now has to be extended, and the new left wing trade-union confederation, UNT, which has the potential power to achieve this goal, needs our international solidarity. Hans-Gerd Öfinger remarked that the Venezuelan counter-revolution has her allies, not only within the Bush administration, but also among European capitalists and ruling classes. Even though a direct intervention by US-Imperialism might not be on the order of today and even though the Opposition appears to be in a ""crisis"" with loss of social backing and public presence, we must not think that now there will be a gradual development and that the ruling class will ever give up peacefully and quietly. This assumption was nurtured by a recent statement made by a liberal MP in Germany who had strongly criticised President Chavez´ left wing speech delivered at the WSF where he referred to socialism. This German Liberal had referred to Venezuela as the coming ""source"" of a Latin American fire, thus demonstrating und justifying plans for further aggression against the Chavez government. Hans-Gerd hammered home the need to show concrete solidarity with the revolutionaries in Venezuela on all levels - in schools, universities, workplaces and trade-unions.

			The 16th WFSY - An Historic Event in the Making",2005-03-02T00:00:00Z,NA,"This August, Caracas, Venezuela will be home to the 16th World Festival of Youth and Students, a festival of politics, art, and culture. The meeting will be held from the 7th to the 15th and will be a convergence of young students and workers from across the globe, united behind the slogan ""For peace and solidarity, we struggle against war and imperialism!"" This is a chance for people to see the revolutionary process first hand, on the grass-roots levels with the revolutionaries of the Venezuelan Bolivarian Republic. It is a great event to look forward to, but the work towards building the festival begins here at home. It is the job of progressive youth in America to take the initiative into their own hands and form their delegation. We have already elected a national steering committee and formed a nation-wide network of Local Organizing Committees (LOCs). We must now expand this network and make it a broad basis on which to form our national delegation. There are steps that we must take to ensure a successful festival and a successful alliance with young workers and students around the world. We must continue to build broad and democratic LOCs, keep up public promotion of the WFYS, and look at the festival itself not as the final event, but as the spring board to the promotion of revolution across Latin America and the world. The process of creating a broad, democratic LOC is easy. In many cases, it is the job with the most instant gratification. For example, the LOC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania began with four people. They quickly began promoting the festival among friends and their own political circles and the LOC began to expand. As the committee began to amass more and more individuals, the membership chose to take the route of getting support from groups on the local campuses. They began making regular appearances at the many political events taking place in the city sponsored by these groups, and flyering among the rank and file. They also got involved with helping others build delegation committees, by making road trips to various campuses around the state and working with students there directly to help build an LOC. Now, there are two consolidated committees in Western and Central Pennsylvania because of this work, and many more fledgling delegations in the making. This is a prime example of how to build an LOC and to promote the festival. Local organizing committees and promotion of the festival are great things to get involved with, yes, but what happens after the festival in September? What about a year from now? What will we do with the bonds we forge at the WFYS, what will we do to really fight against war and imperialism when we get back home? We must actively get involved with defending the revolution in Venezuela, Latin America, and the world! The Hands Off Venezuela campaign has been analyzing the revolution for years now and is working on the ground with the participants. This festival is only the beginning. It is an opportunity to open the door to a broader democratic forum for the revolutionary youth and workers of the world. Let's take the slogan of the WFYS one step further. Let our rallying cry be ""In solidarity with the Venezuelan and world revolutions, we struggle against war and imperialism!"" This is the time for building. This is the time of constructing the basis for our World Revolution, building our forces, and opening channels of communications. This August, the first brick is laid. It will take active participation and careful attention to detail to build for the festival and beyond. See you all in Caracas!",NA,NA

The discussion included comparisons with the People's Power uprisings in the Philippines and how in the Philippines, unlike in Venezuela, the momentum of these mass upsurges had been contained. There were also comments about the need for the Philippine left to study and learn from the unfolding revolution in Venezuela. Workers at the meeting were interested in how workers in Venezuela were responding to company closures and lockouts by taking over the factories and placing them under workers control, with the support of the Chavez government. Participants also discussed the recent initiatives to set up workers militias or people's defense units, indicating the deepening of the revolution as people were armed.

													Hands Off Venezuela","As mentioned in the report on the meeting in Parliament the Venezuelan Ambassador to London, Alfredo Toro Hardy, has given his support to the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. We provide a link here to a video of Mr. Hardy speaking as well as a transcript of his speech in Parliament. The video can be found here . We reproduce the transcript below. -- Grand Committee Room, Houses of Parliament, 2nd February 2005 Alfredo Toro Hardy (Ambassador to London of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela): Thank you very much, it's a great pleasure to be here tonight. I would like to express the gratitude of President Chávez for this movement, this network that has been so active, in which you have group of MPs, that under the leadership of Mr John McDonnell have been able to put down several motions in favour of the Venezuelan government. As well we have a group of authorities from British Unions, and of course we have a grassroots movement, Hands Off Venezuela, which has been tremendously active in promoting solidarity towards the Venezuelan government. President Chávez is well aware of this effort, and as a matter of fact I spoke with him a few days ago and he mentioned that he would like to pass through Britain in a trip he must make to India at the beginning of March, to get in touch with you all and to personally convey his gratitude for this effort. Of course, this hasn't yet been scheduled but we are looking forward to it and we really hope he will be able to make a short stop-over here in London to meet you all. Mr Galindez just made a very interesting approach to the problems being faced by the government internally. Perhaps I could talk a little bit about the problems being faced externally. And essentially I would like to refer to the problems that the Venezuelan government has vis-à-vis the Bush administration in the United States. Essentially I would say there are three areas in which differences emerge: political differences, economic differences and two different perspectives on foreign policy. As for the political differences, I would say that President Chávez' government has been making a tremendous effort in order to empower the majority of the population that traditionally have been excluded. In order to do so, he has promoted a participatory model of democracy in which people have to act, in which people have to defend, people have to be vigilant of the political process. And as a result of that, since his election in 1998, he has promoted all of this. In any case there have been eight electoral processes in which people have been involved participatorily. In all those eight elections, in addition to the one that President Chávez won in 1998, President Chávez himself, his policies or his candidates, have won. Notwithstanding that fact, the United States keeps insisting that we don't have a true democracy in Venezuela. The reason maybe lies in the fact that in the concept of American democracy there is a clear distinction between what they scornfully call ""mass democracy"" and what they call ""liberal democracy"". For them, there is an anti-majoritarian view of politics that goes against this kind of participatory democracy that we tend to promote in Venezuela. And in essence, what they clearly fail to understand is that throughout history - and again, I must say that for them the essence of democracy is the protection of minority - what they fail to understand is precisely that Venezuela, throughout its history, has had governments of the minorities, for the minorities, and by the minorities; and with the exclusion of the majority. And that is precisely what we are trying to correct. This difference is a fundamental difference which is very difficult to overcome. But there is also the economic element. From an economic point of view, the United States tries to impose a market economy like in America, and they tried to impose the Washington Consensus within the region, which of course implies a decalogue of principles like trade liberalisation, privatisation, fiscal reform, and so on and so forth. But the fact is that within the application of these policies the results have been quite clear. Latin America is probably the only region, or certainly the only region in the world, whose economic indicators in the '90s were much worse than they were in the '70s. According to the Latin American Commission of the United Nations, Latin America's GDP decreased by almost 2% between 1997 and 2003. During that same period the number of people living in poverty in the region was essentially increased, as a matter of fact we have twenty million more poor people in 2003 than we had in 1997. So this whole concept of trying to promote this American concept, this market economy concept, of trying to promote economic growth through a market economy with a final end of generating a ""trickle-down"" that someday, sometime, someplace will generate social justice, is clearly not working in Latin America. What President Chávez proposes is just the opposite: emphasising the human being, emphasising education, health-care, social and civic consciousness, new political parties, social capital. That is, trying to promote a more human society and a much more productive citizen. At the end of the day, instead of a ""trickle-down"" it's a sort of a ""trickle-up"", in which a much more conscious and prepared citizen will be able to produce prosperity. There is also the main difference from the point of view of foreign policy. The United States promotes unilateralism, unipolarity, prevention of international laws, and of course a tight control of Latin America within the context of the Free Trade Area of the Americas; whereas Venezuela with President Chávez' government proposes co-operative multi-lateralism, multi-polarity, international law, and of course a Latin America as independent as possible, within the context of a Free Trade Area of Latin America. Of course, this last point is perhaps the most sensitive for the Americans because they would like to see us as a part of their economy. But the example of Mexico speaks for itself. Mexico is a bordering country to the United States, which has a very powerful ethnic lobby within the United States. And notwithstanding that reality, Mexico is in a very difficult position as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico had to relinquish some fundamental sectors of its economy in order to integrate itself to the United States, among them agriculture. Those sectors have been totally swept off, and notwithstanding that fact, Mexico is cornered because it's incapable of competing with the Chinese products within the American market. If that happens to Mexico, what may happen to the rest of Latin America? Hence, President Chávez' emphasis on creating our own model of Latin American integration. It's not only about jobs, but it's rational. There are some fundamental differences, but at the end of the day, we need the solidarity of all of you. It is fundamental because we are facing a tremendous campaign which every day is felt, through the mass media, the declarations of Washington authorities, and through many governments which are close allies with Washington. We need your solidarity and we are very grateful for it. Thank you very much. As mentioned in the report on the meeting in Parliament the Venezuelan Ambassador to London, Alfredo Toro Hardy, has given his support to the Hands Off Venezuela campaign.

The United States promotes unilateralism, unipolarity, prevention of international laws, and of course a tight control of Latin America within the context of the Free Trade Area of the Americas; whereas Venezuela with President Chávez' government proposes co-operative multi-lateralism, multi-polarity, international law, and of course a Latin America as independent as possible, within the context of a Free Trade Area of Latin America. Of course, this last point is perhaps the most sensitive for the Americans because they would like to see us as a part of their economy. But the example of Mexico speaks for itself. Mexico is a bordering country to the United States, which has a very powerful ethnic lobby within the United States. And notwithstanding that reality, Mexico is in a very difficult position as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico had to relinquish some fundamental sectors of its economy in order to integrate itself to the United States, among them agriculture. Those sectors have been totally swept off, and notwithstanding that fact, Mexico is cornered because it's incapable of competing with the Chinese products within the American market. If that happens to Mexico, what may happen to the rest of Latin America? Hence, President Chávez' emphasis on creating our own model of Latin American integration. It's not only about jobs, but it's rational. There are some fundamental differences, but at the end of the day, we need the solidarity of all of you. It is fundamental because we are facing a tremendous campaign which every day is felt, through the mass media, the declarations of Washington authorities, and through many governments which are close allies with Washington. We need your solidarity and we are very grateful for it. Thank you very much. ",NA,NA

			Jorge Martin speaks in the Six Counties - another stone laid in the building of Hands Off Venezuela",2005-02-25T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Tomas Gorman"," We are very delighted to publish this report on Jorge Martin's speaking tour in Ireland. The author is a young Republican Socialist based in Belfast with a long experience in anti-imperialist solidarity such as the ""Boycott Coca-Cola"" campaign and the movement against the imperialist war on Iraq. --- ""How many people are you expecting to attend this evening?"" Jorge enquires of me over a cup of coffee in Belfast’s An Culturlann and to be honest, I wasn’t sure how to answer his question. Despite a flurry of promotional activity during the previous week, it was difficult to predict how many people would break a growing pattern of political apathy in West Belfast and actually bother to turn up to the event. To compound my concerns, I had just heard that Sinn Fein had organised a protest to highlight what they see as a ""Crisis of Democracy"" meaning a lot of their activists would miss the film and the debate that I hoped would follow. I cursed the irony of this eventuality. As the political pressure was heaping upon them, Provisional Sinn Fein planned a protest against an attack on the bourgeois democratic system that the ""Venezuela Bolivariana, people & struggle in the fourth World War"" film so clearly illustrates as corrupt and undemocratic. Alas, I thought, it was an opportunity missed. At ten to seven, there was only myself, Jorge and another guy who had volunteered to take some photos and I had secretly resigned myself to the event’s failure. Then as luck would have it, a small group of people arrived at the theatre looking a little lost and after some investigating downstairs, I had found a large group of people looking for the room in which the event was taking place. After directing the crowd upstairs, I was bouyed to see more and more people arriving until there was a crowd of around 45 people sitting in the row of the small arena, a handsome number at an event of this kind. The promotional activity had paid off, it seems. During the week running up to the event, myself and some kind volunteers had spent a couple of days plastering up around 200 posters around the working class areas of West Belfast. A fortune was spent on text messages, emails were sent to thousands of recipients and every newspaper with a wide readership had been hit with a torrent of daily press releases on the event. When Jorge arrived in Belfast, he didn’t really have much time to “enjoy” the cold weather as he was giving an interview on a Belfast community radio show as well as an interview to a journalist who writes for the Andersonstown News (a tabloid sensationalist type local paper but with a wide readership none the less). Now he had settled down to give a good sized and well represented audience an introduction to the film. The feelings in the arena were tangible during the emotive scenes in the film. The audience were noticebaly moved by the scenes of the Venezuelan people showing the power of collective action in the face of often brutal repression and the applause at the end indicated how well the film’s contents were recieved. The potential debate however was somewhat unfulfilled. The large numbers attending perhaps intimidated some audience members from enquiring on the subject. Jorge however gave a clear and lengthy summary of some of the more up to date events in the revolution as well as elaboration on some of the important points in the film and as is generally the case in these matters, futher debate carried on in the pub long after the film ended. Next stop Derry, and after meeting some comrades, Jorge and myself set off for BBC Radio Foyle where Jorge was afforded a brief interview with the afternoon talk show DJ Mark Patterson where the night event was plugged and the revolution was given a brief summary. The Derry event was held in Sandino’s Bar which is seen as a bar visited by progressive and leftwing people as evidenced by the name. Despite a lower turnout than the Belfast event (some 20-25 people), the film sparked a greater degree of debate. The audience contained a good representation of the city’s left wing, including the SWP, SEA as well as the IRSP and some People’s Democracy members. The scenes of state violence used to quell the Caracas riots in 1989 mirrored that of the scenes of Derry’s Bloody Sunday and this was picked up by the audience who then drew further parallelles between the Venezuelan Bolivarian process and the Irish class struggle. The third and last event took place in Strabane, a large border town some 20 miles from Derry, but due to unforeseen difficulties, the venue of the event had to be changed, but the local IRSP comrades gently provided their offices to host the meeting. The audience was made up of young Socialist comrades who despite their young age, took to the film’s message of the collective power of the people. Some debate took place after the event and I was heartened to see some of the young comrades avail themselves of some of the literature provided by Jorge Martin. The speaker made an important point in his address at the Belfast event. ""The Venezuelan Revolution is having a positive effect in Cuba in that it is giving renewed heart and encouragement after forty plus years of isolation."" During a time when radical politics is on the decline here in Ireland it has also given me and others like me hope that there is still a place and role for a true democracy of the people. The Venezuelan Revolution of the people’s conscienceness is today’s reference to all progressive people’s struggles throughout the world and I hope to use it as such when I debate with other brothers and sisters about the future direction of the class struggle in Ireland. I also hope some of the others who watched the film during Jorge’s short visit do the same. Just for that reason, Jorge's visit has been extremely useful and I look forward to working with him and the Hands Off Venezuela comrades in the future.

													Hands Off Venezuela","     Coinciding with the anniversary of the February 27, 1989 uprising in Venezuela,   organised a very successful speaking tour in France with Jorge Martin of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. The activities were organised together with the Bolivarian Circles of   and   and in Portes-lès-Valence by the local section of the Communist Party.  The first meeting was in Paris on March 1st, and took place in the headquarters of the Communist Party of the 10th District, and was  chaired by Daniel Yegres, president of the Paris Bolivarian Circle. The meeting room was completely packed with about 60 people present despite the very cold weather. This is the 3rd time meetings on the Bolivarian Revolution have been organised in these premises, so quite a lot of the people present were already acquainted with the events. Nevertheless, the recent turn in the Venezuelan revolution in which Chavez has openly raised the need to go beyond capitalism and move in the direction of socialism made it a particularly enthusiastic gathering. There were a number of comrades from the local Communist Party section in audience, including the branch secretary Jean-Pierre Leroux, who is an enthusiastic supporter of the campaign. The collection raised around 120 euro, and 40 copies of different pamphlets on the Venezuelan revolution produced by La Riposte were sold.   The next meeting took place on Thursday, March 3rd at the University of Toulouse (Le Mirail) and was organised jointly with the local Bolivarian Circle, which was established after the previous meeting of the campaign there in November. The meeting was chaired by Christophe Cambefort, a member of the Tolouse Bolivarian Circle and the secretary of the local Young Communist branch. More than 130 people filled the amphitheatre and again were very interested to hear about the latest developments in Venezuela, including the nationalisation of Venepal under workers’ control, the speeding up of the land reform, the question of socialism raised by Chavez and the renewed campaign of Washington against the Bolivarian revolution. There were many questions dealing with a wide range of issues, including the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba, the actions of the Colombian government, land reform, the Bolivarian University, the World Festival of Youth and Students in Caracas this coming August, etc. A collection was held at the end, and as in Paris, quite a lot of pamphlets on Venezuela (including one on Chavez’s speech at Porto Alegre by Alan Woods, and on the nationalisation of Venepal) were sold. A follow up meeting of the Bolivarian Circle has already been planned in order to continue the campaign.   Finally, the meeting organised in Portes-lès-Valence by the local Communist Party section and chaired by its secretary Pierre Trapier, was particularly interesting. More than 30 people turned up at the George Brassens municipal meeting hall, including a number of PCF members and CGT trade unionists. For most of them this was the first time they had heard about the Venezuelan Revolution, and they were particularly interested to hear Jorge Martin explain the unfolding of the Bolivarian movement since its origins, which can be traced back the brutal suppression of the February 27th, 1989 uprising. Just about all the people present signed up to get involved in the Hands Off  Venezuela Campaign, and the idea of creating a local Bolivarian Circle was enthusiastically taken up. This work will be coordinated by Maxence Fay, a young member of the PCF in the area and supporter of La Riposte. In the course of the debate, a CGT member raised the question about the need to campaign within the trade union movement in France in order to gain recognition for the recently created UNT trade union confederation in Venezuela. We particularly would like to thank the PCF members in Portes-lès-Valence for the extremely warm, friendly and hospitable way in which they received us.

													Ricardo Galindez","The following is a transcript from a talk given by Venezuelan trade unionist Ricardo Galindez at the East Anglia Social Forum during his recent tour of Britain. I will start from the very beginnings of 2003 and what happened then. The events that took place at the end of 2002 and 2003 were preceded by the coup that took place at the beginning of 2002. The political factions and the bosses that had been removed from power with the election of Hugo Chavez did not stop their attempts to plot the overthrow of Chavez. Even shortly after the victory of the masses against the coup d'état, the bosses and the oligarchy started plotting against the democratic government and promoted some marches against the government. At the end of 2002 the imperialists and the local oligarchy tried to carry out sabotage in the oil industry in order to block the economy and try to push the people against the Venezuelan government itself. The ruling class in Venezuela did not understand that the defeat that they suffered on the 11th of April 2002 was just a show of strength of the working classes in Venezuela, because the masses identified themselves with the ongoing revolutionary process. Maybe it’s not what everyone expected, but it is the very beginning of something bigger. While on the 11th April people came out onto the streets to defend their democratic civil rights, in December of the same year we could see how the people as well as the working class tried to defend the revolution. We could see how the bosses were paying workers to stay at home in order to carry out sabotage against the Venezuelan economy, we could see the answer of the working class in various cities and towns around Venezuela that continued to carry out their working activity in order to defeat this sabotage that was being carried out by the oligarchy and the imperialists. We could see how in the countryside on the massive land estates and in some sectors of industry and also in the oil industry the workers were producing under workers’ control. There were no bosses at all. In a wide range of industry, such as the sugar producing industry and also the most important of all, the oil industry, we could see how the workers were producing under their own control. There was the example of the oil refinery in Puerto la Cruz where the workers took it over and were carrying out economic activity themselves. In El Palito there was also workers’ control and in the other refinery the workers maintained production for two months with no bosses and strict discipline in the company. Once the lock out was defeated in the oil industry, the bosses decided to extend the lockout to education. As soon as the parents and the pupils saw that the schools had been closed, they decided to reopen them, sometimes occupying the schools, asking the government to send teachers to the schools and sometimes when they didn’t have teachers the parents provided lessons to the pupils. Meanwhile the imperialists and the local oligarchy did not give up their attempt to create chaos. They called demonstrations and marches which were answered by the Bolivarian movement with bigger marches, bigger demonstrations. Let’s say that if the opposition were taking out on the streets ten thousand, the Bolivarians were taking out one hundred thousand, and if they took out onto the streets one hundred thousand we took out three hundred thousand – always outnumbering them. Then the local and the mainstream media, all the newspapers, all the TV channels started a campaign to call for a presidential recall referendum. This referendum was defeated. What happened was that, when they saw that by illegal means they could not force the government out, they decided to take the legal road. They decided to start again their campaign for a recall referendum. What happened was that the electoral commission of Venezuela gave up and said okay you can have the referendum. The point is that it is true that this referendum was not well received among the masses and people were quite angry. When President Chavez said now is the time to unite forces and defeat the referendum, well, we did it and defeated this process. Even if they were not happy with that, they decided that they had to do it because that was a historical moment for the Venezuelan masses. For the first time in history the Venezuelan people were going to organise an electoral process under their control and through popular organisations like the Electoral Battle Units and other popular organisations 1,200,000 people organised themselves. Students and workers organised in these UBEs, Electoral Battle Units. Well, of course, the workers and students in the neighbourhoods organised themselves. They set up the structures to canvass in order to win this recall referendum. The victory in this recall referendum for the ‘NO’ option against the recall of Hugo Chavez was the beginning of a new period in the Venezuelan revolution. Let’s say that the oligarchy could not cope with a defeat and they did lose lots of support from the middle classes. They suffered the disbandment of their own forces and suddenly their own leaders no longer appeared on TV and in the newspapers, and did not show up in public life. After the success of the recall referendum the regional council elections took place and the Opposition, the oligarchy, was limited to holding on to just two states. Now the struggle of the Opposition is based in the state of Zulia, a region on the border with Colombia, an area very rich in oil. Even the governor of this state, once he saw the results, started to shift his position towards President Chavez! Defeat was terrible for them. The umbrella group, that they had organised all the opposition parties under, has been disbanded. After the defeat, Mendoza, the governor of the state of Carabobo, disappeared from public life after the defeat. The more astute sections of the bourgeoisie started to approach President Chavez in order to appear more polite towards him. They began to moderate their opposition to Chavez. As the saying goes, if you cannot beat them, join them until you have enough forces to defeat them. This is the policy of imperialism and the local bourgeoisie in Venezuela today. After the great defeat suffered in the eighties the labour movement had started to recover in the nineties. At the beginning of the nineties the workers decided to set up a new trade union federation outside of the CTV. It was in 2002 that they finally decided to abandon the CTV and set up a new Venezuelan trade union federation. It is true that in the beginning they had many problems to overcome, however they are overcoming these and now they are back at the same level of organisation as before. Due to the lockout that took place at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, there were many companies that were closed down. What is true is that most of these companies closed down due to imperialist sabotage of the economy, and after the defeat of the lockout these companies remained closed. At that time many workers decided to reopen the factories, occupy them and run them by themselves and they demanded that the government nationalise these factories under workers’ controls as well as many other factories. This movement was the beginning of the victory that was to take place at Venepal. With regards to Venepal this company was closed down in 2003, then the government helped the bosses to reopen it. Later on they closed down the factory again, and the second victory of the Venepal workers was when the government decided to nationalise the company under workers’ control. It is not clear what form of workers’ control this company is going to adopt. Whether it is going to be a co-op, direct control of the workers or a shared control of the company by workers and the state. However, what is true is that the plan the government is going to undertake is the plan elaborated by the workers in the company. The decision of the government to take this company over is a massive victory. It is true that the government has not expressed a will to nationalise all companies. They say that this is not going to be the main trend, but they also say that the Venepal example is going to be the model for other companies that have closed down and have not reopened yet. The Venepal experience also boosts the confidence of the workers in Venezuela because they can see the possibility of working for a company where the boss is not a coup plotter. All these measures, the nationalisation, the war against the big landed estates, the latifundia, the process of land reform and also the deepening of the revolution, the “Into the neighbourhoods” social programme, on health care in the poorest neighbourhoods, are all having an effect. For instance, they have announced the building of six hundred hospitals across the country. All of this is a major victory, a step forward for the movement. These are the questions that concern imperialism, that concern the Venezuelan opposition. We should remember that the US has been suffering from the Cuba syndrome since 1961. At that time, in 1961, the revolution that initially was based on many democratic demands was later forced to go beyond the confines of capitalism. It was forced to take socialist measures. This is what the imperialists are worried about. And this brings us to the latest Rodrigo Granda [FARC Foreign minister] case. He is a Colombian citizen who came to Venezuela and naturalised himself as Venezuelan. He had both nationalities, Colombian and Venezuelan. He was not living in underground conditions; he was living with his family under his own name. He was recently kidnapped by Venezuelan police that had been bribed beforehand by the Colombian authorities. The imperialists have thus staged a stunt “against terrorism” and so forth. The Venezuelan opposition recently tried to gather its forces once again and launched another march that took place on January 23. The aim was to heat things up but they were not successful. The march was a complete failure. As if this were not bad enough for the opposition, the government called another march where hundreds of thousands of people turned out in the streets. The government gave only four or five days’ notice to call this demonstration. This shows that, as opposed to the forces of reaction, of the opposition, that are completely demoralised and demobilises, the Venezuelan people support the process of strengthening democracy and deepening the revolution. They are very active and have the ability to mobilise themselves. It’s true that the opposition has been defeated more than once and is demoralise. However, the imperialists have not given up. They are staging more actions against the Venezuelan revolution. The imperialists are active and are looking for the easiest way to create trouble. Yes, the imperialists are active, but we are also active! We are pushing for things like nationalisation, land reform, the deepening of the social programmes and trying to sort out all the problems we have and to carry on. I believe that from the point of view of all the people who are involved in the trade unions, the only way to achieve victory for the Venezuelan revolution is to go beyond the confines of capitalism and to install socialism in Venezuela. Question: “I was just wondering, it was very interesting to hear about the occupied factories. Are the occupied factories in Venezuela in much contact with the occupied factories in Argentina? I didn’t realise it had been happening in other countries as well.” Answer: Today there is no such communication between factories occupied in Argentina and those occupied in Venezuela. However, two years ago when the process was alive and the workers started to occupy the factories, a delegation of Argentinean workers was invited by the secretary of labour in Venezuela to come over to visit the occupied factories. At that time, when we had some activities, they exchanged experiences, and at the end of this visit the ministry of labour drafted a plan based on the Argentinean experience and now they are going to use this to carry out all the necessary action for the reopening of Venezuelan factories. Even now that we have achieved the nationalisation of Venepal, we should invite workers from Argentinean factories to go over to Venezuela to share more experiences. Q: How does the organisation operate at grass roots level, because there are so many people involved? I’m interested in how they communicate. I’m not entirely clear how much the policy such as land reform is driven by the government and how much by the mass movement making the government do it. A: Right now it is true that the government is leading the process, however we can see that from below there is a force. There is a mass of people that is pushing to have its demands heard, the demands of the community on the government. There are also land committees, grass roots organisations, that try to implement land reform not only in the countryside but also in the cities. There are also community labour groups that have managed to get works approved for new socially useful buildings and things of this kind, that are going to be controlled by the community. Q: You mentioned workers’ control. I’m interested in this. We read it in the papers that the paper industry is coming under workers’ control. It is clear that this is far deeper than the nationalisation we have seen here in Britain. But it does not involve the whole economy. So how does it actually work? If you work in a factory that is run under workers’ control what would that mean for me in terms of how I influence what goes on? A: Right now in Venezuela they already have experience of workers’ control in the sugar refineries. The company that the government nationalised was handed over to the workers and also to the cane sugar workers, the ones who carry the cane sugar. The company has been working well. The workers elect their own representatives to the board of administration of the company. But at the same time they also organise their own trade union. Now, this company, in spite of all the problems, is the most productive company in Venezuela. Then, there is the example of the workers in the old state owned oil company in 2002-2003. Those workers through meetings in the factories decided what to produce, how to produce it and when to produce it. The oil workers had the support of the armed forces and the community was also there offering them support. They had the power to decide on production, distribution, supply and so forth. How could they go back to a so-called ‘normal situation’ where the workers are given orders? The Venepal workers elaborated a project, in the form of a book with 200 to 300 pages. In this book the workers explain every little detail concerning production, from the machines, to the sheets, everything is in there, even the tea machine. And that was when the company was first closed, when the government pumped some money into the company the first time in 2001. At that time they won a right, it was a kind of shared control of the company. There was a machine that was needed to produce power, to produce electricity. This machine broke down, so they called a technician from Germany where the machine had been originally produced. Well the workers decided to fix the machine without asking the management and now this machine is still there producing more power than before. It shows the enormous potential of the workers. The following is a transcript from a talk given by Venezuelan trade unionist Ricardo Galindez at the East Anglia Social Forum during his recent tour of Britain. I will start from the very beginnings of 2003 and what happened then. The events that took place at the end of 2002 and 2003 were preceded by the coup that took place at the beginning of 2002. The political factions and the bosses that had been removed from power with the election of Hugo Chavez did not stop their attempts to plot the overthrow of Chavez. Even shortly after the victory of the masses against the coup d'état, the bosses and the oligarchy started plotting against the democratic government and promoted some marches against the government. At the end of 2002 the imperialists and the local oligarchy tried to carry out sabotage in the oil industry in order to block the economy and try to push the people against the Venezuelan government itself. The ruling class in Venezuela did not understand that the defeat that they suffered on the 11th of April 2002 was just a show of strength of the working classes in Venezuela, because the masses identified themselves with the ongoing revolutionary process. Maybe it’s not what everyone expected, but it is the very beginning of something bigger. While on the 11th April people came out onto the streets to defend their democratic civil rights, in December of the same year we could see how the people as well as the working class tried to defend the revolution. We could see how the bosses were paying workers to stay at home in order to carry out sabotage against the Venezuelan economy, we could see the answer of the working class in various cities and towns around Venezuela that continued to carry out their working activity in order to defeat this sabotage that was being carried out by the oligarchy and the imperialists. We could see how in the countryside on the massive land estates and in some sectors of industry and also in the oil industry the workers were producing under workers’ control. There were no bosses at all. In a wide range of industry, such as the sugar producing industry and also the most important of all, the oil industry, we could see how the workers were producing under their own control. There was the example of the oil refinery in Puerto la Cruz where the workers took it over and were carrying out economic activity themselves. In El Palito there was also workers’ control and in the other refinery the workers maintained production for two months with no bosses and strict discipline in the company. Once the lock out was defeated in the oil industry, the bosses decided to extend the lockout to education. As soon as the parents and the pupils saw that the schools had been closed, they decided to reopen them, sometimes occupying the schools, asking the government to send teachers to the schools and sometimes when they didn’t have teachers the parents provided lessons to the pupils. Meanwhile the imperialists and the local oligarchy did not give up their attempt to create chaos. They called demonstrations and marches which were answered by the Bolivarian movement with bigger marches, bigger demonstrations. Let’s say that if the opposition were taking out on the streets ten thousand, the Bolivarians were taking out one hundred thousand, and if they took out onto the streets one hundred thousand we took out three hundred thousand – always outnumbering them. Then the local and the mainstream media, all the newspapers, all the TV channels started a campaign to call for a presidential recall referendum. This referendum was defeated. What happened was that, when they saw that by illegal means they could not force the government out, they decided to take the legal road. They decided to start again their campaign for a recall referendum. What happened was that the electoral commission of Venezuela gave up and said okay you can have the referendum. The point is that it is true that this referendum was not well received among the masses and people were quite angry. When President Chavez said now is the time to unite forces and defeat the referendum, well, we did it and defeated this process. Even if they were not happy with that, they decided that they had to do it because that was a historical moment for the Venezuelan masses. For the first time in history the Venezuelan people were going to organise an electoral process under their control and through popular organisations like the Electoral Battle Units and other popular organisations 1,200,000 people organised themselves. Students and workers organised in these UBEs, Electoral Battle Units. Well, of course, the workers and students in the neighbourhoods organised themselves. They set up the structures to canvass in order to win this recall referendum. The victory in this recall referendum for the ‘NO’ option against the recall of Hugo Chavez was the beginning of a new period in the Venezuelan revolution. Let’s say that the oligarchy could not cope with a defeat and they did lose lots of support from the middle classes. They suffered the disbandment of their own forces and suddenly their own leaders no longer appeared on TV and in the newspapers, and did not show up in public life. After the success of the recall referendum the regional council elections took place and the Opposition, the oligarchy, was limited to holding on to just two states. Now the struggle of the Opposition is based in the state of Zulia, a region on the border with Colombia, an area very rich in oil. Even the governor of this state, once he saw the results, started to shift his position towards President Chavez! Defeat was terrible for them. The umbrella group, that they had organised all the opposition parties under, has been disbanded. After the defeat, Mendoza, the governor of the state of Carabobo, disappeared from public life after the defeat. The more astute sections of the bourgeoisie started to approach President Chavez in order to appear more polite towards him. They began to moderate their opposition to Chavez. As the saying goes, if you cannot beat them, join them until you have enough forces to defeat them. This is the policy of imperialism and the local bourgeoisie in Venezuela today. After the great defeat suffered in the eighties the labour movement had started to recover in the nineties. At the beginning of the nineties the workers decided to set up a new trade union federation outside of the CTV. It was in 2002 that they finally decided to abandon the CTV and set up a new Venezuelan trade union federation. It is true that in the beginning they had many problems to overcome, however they are overcoming these and now they are back at the same level of organisation as before. Due to the lockout that took place at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, there were many companies that were closed down. What is true is that most of these companies closed down due to imperialist sabotage of the economy, and after the defeat of the lockout these companies remained closed. At that time many workers decided to reopen the factories, occupy them and run them by themselves and they demanded that the government nationalise these factories under workers’ controls as well as many other factories. This movement was the beginning of the victory that was to take place at Venepal. With regards to Venepal this company was closed down in 2003, then the government helped the bosses to reopen it. Later on they closed down the factory again, and the second victory of the Venepal workers was when the government decided to nationalise the company under workers’ control. It is not clear what form of workers’ control this company is going to adopt. Whether it is going to be a co-op, direct control of the workers or a shared control of the company by workers and the state. However, what is true is that the plan the government is going to undertake is the plan elaborated by the workers in the company. The decision of the government to take this company over is a massive victory. It is true that the government has not expressed a will to nationalise all companies. They say that this is not going to be the main trend, but they also say that the Venepal example is going to be the model for other companies that have closed down and have not reopened yet. The Venepal experience also boosts the confidence of the workers in Venezuela because they can see the possibility of working for a company where the boss is not a coup plotter. All these measures, the nationalisation, the war against the big landed estates, the latifundia, the process of land reform and also the deepening of the revolution, the “Into the neighbourhoods” social programme, on health care in the poorest neighbourhoods, are all having an effect. For instance, they have announced the building of six hundred hospitals across the country. All of this is a major victory, a step forward for the movement. These are the questions that concern imperialism, that concern the Venezuelan opposition. We should remember that the US has been suffering from the Cuba syndrome since 1961. At that time, in 1961, the revolution that initially was based on many democratic demands was later forced to go beyond the confines of capitalism. It was forced to take socialist measures. This is what the imperialists are worried about. And this brings us to the latest Rodrigo Granda [FARC Foreign minister] case. He is a Colombian citizen who came to Venezuela and naturalised himself as Venezuelan. He had both nationalities, Colombian and Venezuelan. He was not living in underground conditions; he was living with his family under his own name. He was recently kidnapped by Venezuelan police that had been bribed beforehand by the Colombian authorities. The imperialists have thus staged a stunt “against terrorism” and so forth. The Venezuelan opposition recently tried to gather its forces once again and launched another march that took place on January 23. The aim was to heat things up but they were not successful. The march was a complete failure. As if this were not bad enough for the opposition, the government called another march where hundreds of thousands of people turned out in the streets. The government gave only four or five days’ notice to call this demonstration. This shows that, as opposed to the forces of reaction, of the opposition, that are completely demoralised and demobilises, the Venezuelan people support the process of strengthening democracy and deepening the revolution. They are very active and have the ability to mobilise themselves. It’s true that the opposition has been defeated more than once and is demoralise. However, the imperialists have not given up. They are staging more actions against the Venezuelan revolution. The imperialists are active and are looking for the easiest way to create trouble. Yes, the imperialists are active, but we are also active! We are pushing for things like nationalisation, land reform, the deepening of the social programmes and trying to sort out all the problems we have and to carry on. I believe that from the point of view of all the people who are involved in the trade unions, the only way to achieve victory for the Venezuelan revolution is to go beyond the confines of capitalism and to install socialism in Venezuela. Question: “I was just wondering, it was very interesting to hear about the occupied factories. Are the occupied factories in Venezuela in much contact with the occupied factories in Argentina? I didn’t realise it had been happening in other countries as well.” Answer: Today there is no such communication between factories occupied in Argentina and those occupied in Venezuela. However, two years ago when the process was alive and the workers started to occupy the factories, a delegation of Argentinean workers was invited by the secretary of labour in Venezuela to come over to visit the occupied factories. At that time, when we had some activities, they exchanged experiences, and at the end of this visit the ministry of labour drafted a plan based on the Argentinean experience and now they are going to use this to carry out all the necessary action for the reopening of Venezuelan factories. Even now that we have achieved the nationalisation of Venepal, we should invite workers from Argentinean factories to go over to Venezuela to share more experiences. Q: How does the organisation operate at grass roots level, because there are so many people involved? I’m interested in how they communicate. I’m not entirely clear how much the policy such as land reform is driven by the government and how much by the mass movement making the government do it. A: Right now it is true that the government is leading the process, however we can see that from below there is a force. There is a mass of people that is pushing to have its demands heard, the demands of the community on the government. There are also land committees, grass roots organisations, that try to implement land reform not only in the countryside but also in the cities. There are also community labour groups that have managed to get works approved for new socially useful buildings and things of this kind, that are going to be controlled by the community. Q: You mentioned workers’ control. I’m interested in this. We read it in the papers that the paper industry is coming under workers’ control. It is clear that this is far deeper than the nationalisation we have seen here in Britain. But it does not involve the whole economy. So how does it actually work? If you work in a factory that is run under workers’ control what would that mean for me in terms of how I influence what goes on? A: Right now in Venezuela they already have experience of workers’ control in the sugar refineries. The company that the government nationalised was handed over to the workers and also to the cane sugar workers, the ones who carry the cane sugar. The company has been working well. The workers elect their own representatives to the board of administration of the company. But at the same time they also organise their own trade union. Now, this company, in spite of all the problems, is the most productive company in Venezuela. Then, there is the example of the workers in the old state owned oil company in 2002-2003. Those workers through meetings in the factories decided what to produce, how to produce it and when to produce it. The oil workers had the support of the armed forces and the community was also there offering them support. They had the power to decide on production, distribution, supply and so forth. How could they go back to a so-called ‘normal situation’ where the workers are given orders? The Venepal workers elaborated a project, in the form of a book with 200 to 300 pages. In this book the workers explain every little detail concerning production, from the machines, to the sheets, everything is in there, even the tea machine. And that was when the company was first closed, when the government pumped some money into the company the first time in 2001. At that time they won a right, it was a kind of shared control of the company. There was a machine that was needed to produce power, to produce electricity. This machine broke down, so they called a technician from Germany where the machine had been originally produced. Well the workers decided to fix the machine without asking the management and now this machine is still there producing more power than before. It shows the enormous potential of the workers.",NA,NA

													Ricardo Galindez","I would like to take the opportunity you have offered to me to speak on the historic developments in my country, which are today the most dynamic on the Latin American continent. The Venezuelan people have stood up against a past of miseries and humiliations. We have said, “Enough is enough” and have started to lay down the basis of a new country. This is why the old national oligarchy, financed by dollars from the CIA and the Pentagon and supported by the mere puppets like the Colombian government or Blair in United Kingdom, have united in a “holy crusade” to rescue the “holy land”. We have taken the first few steps, headed by the government of President Chavez, and we conquered a consciousness of political dignity and also healthcare and education services, things that in the past only existed in our dreams. Although this is little compared to what we deserve and what we can achieve, the oligarchy believes that we do not deserve these things. This is why the oligarchy, with the help of their great economic power and the intrusive dollars of US imperialism, have organised coup d’etats, marches, economic sabotage and propaganda campaigns to manipulate the situation. However, all this power has not been enough to stop us. We have defeated them in every battle, and have consolidated our victories by taking measures to strengthen state control over our main industry. We have organised popular battalions through the Bolivarian Circles and UBEs (Electoral Battle Units). The working class itself has built its own organisations like the National Union of Workers (UNT), which has become the main trade union federation of our country. In our thirst for justice we demanded the nationalisation of certain companies. As a result of this struggle the Chavez government has heard our demands and has nationalised the Venepal group and granted resources to run the company under the co-management of the workers and the state. This means that the doors are opened to the rescue of thousands of workplaces ignored by “Golpista” bosses. We are here today not only to tell you about the results of our efforts but also to recognise that those results would not have been possible without the participation and militant solidarity of thousands of workers, intellectuals, members of parliament from many countries, students, democratic activists and revolutionary militants from all over the world. We are here today and tomorrow we will be in other cities in Ireland and the UK in order to let you know that the days ahead are going to be even more difficult. The assassination of more than one hundred brothers and sisters, amongst them the prosecutor Danilo Anderson, and the provocation known as the “Granda Case” launched by US imperialism through the puppet Alvaro Uribe Vélez, clearly show this. It is very important that the militant solidarity with our revolutionary process is strengthened. President Hugo Chavez has described this process as a revolutionary, anti-imperialist process which is against capitalism. He has also recently said that the only way out of the crisis created by capitalism is socialism - true socialism. Socialism is the system where the workers have power and decisions made at all levels are the result of a democratic discussion of the oppressed and exploited people through their grassroots organizations. The leadership of these organizations would not be privileged and would be democratically elected. The people who elected them would be able to recall them at any time. These leaders would live as the workers live, ensuring that they always think as working people. Comrades, the Venezuelan Revolution is a living process that requires your conscious solidarity. To give your solidarity is like planting the tree of life which tomorrow will bear fruit. This fruit can be used to carry out your own future revolution, the terms of which will be decided by the workers and the people of your country. This will be a struggle against an enemy already weakened by our victory.

													Ray Smith","Ricardo Galindez’s trip to Ireland over the weekend was a big success. Ricardo was a delegate to the founding conference of the Venezuelan UNT, a union that was built in opposition to the completely bureaucratised CTV that has gone over to the reactionary oligarchy in Venezuela. He is currently an official of the union and trade union adviser. The trip was part of Galindez’s speaking tour to build international solidarity with the Venezuelan Revolution. During his 36 hour-long visit comrade Galindez met with some Latin American Solidarity Centre (LASC) activists, who organised the Dublin part of Ricardo’s tour. On the evening of February 5, Galindez, along with LASC and Hands Off Venezuela activists, visited Jack O’Connor, President of the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU). During the two-hour meeting with O’Connor Galindez outlined the current situation in Venezuela. He analysed the revolutionary process and the situation the Venezuelan labour movement is facing. He explained that the workers are leaving the empty shell of the discredited CTV in droves and are moving into the UNT. The CTV was closely associated with the bosses who were behind the 2002 coup attempt to overthrow Chavez. It is openly supporting the forces of imperialism rather than the interests of the Venezuelan workers. On this basis Ricardo explained the importance of recognising the UNT as the legitimate Trade Union Confederation in Venezuela. O’Connor was also invited to visit Venezuela together with other trade union leaders so that they could see for themselves what is really happening in the country and see first hand the massive campaign of slander and lies which is being mounted against the Venezuelan revolution and the democratic and anti-capitalist movement represented by the UNT. O’Connor was also asked to invite Venezuelan trade unionists to address the leaders and the rank and file of the Irish trade union movement. The two trade unionists expressed the importance and necessity of developing solidarity with Venezuela and weakening the positions of US imperialism and the transnational corporations that are seek to destroy the revolution. They also expressed the importance of strengthening workers’ struggles in different countries in order to defeat the common enemy. O’Connor praised Galindez’s visit and promised to address the different bodies of the union with regards to Venezuela and analyse what exactly the SIPTU could do to defend trade union rights. He expressed his full support for the Venezuelan people and the referendum victory on August 15, 2004. Ricardo Galindez’s trip to Ireland over the weekend was a big success.

These were the words of the brothers and sisters of LASC (Latin American Solidarity Centre). 115 people attended the meeting to hear Ricardo Galindez speak. Richard Gott, former Latin American correspondent for The Guardian , was present at the meeting and explained the events that have unfolded since the very first electoral victory of Hugo Chavez. He pointed out that even then a strategy to oust him was being prepared. The British journalist said he had been to Venezuela and that he had witnessed the development of the social programmes known as “misiones”, and explained how beneficial they were for the ordinary working people. Mick McCaughan, the author of The Battle for Venezuela , was also at the meeting. He briefly spoke about the position of the Venezuelan revolutionary process in the context of the general struggle taking place across the whole of Latin America, where important struggles and movements have been developing in countries like Bolivia, Peru and Argentina amongst others. Ricardo Galindez explained just how important the revolution in Venezuela is. The ability of the Venezuelan masses to mobilise and organise themselves has been demonstrated through the formation of the Bolivarian Circles, UBEs (Electoral Battle Units), the social programmes, and the creation of new trade unions and the UNT itself. What this shows is that the revolutionary process is on the ascent. Galindez stressed the need to develop solidarity with the revolution because international solidarity can be a powerful weapon in the struggle against US imperialism and the transnational corporations that are attempting to isolate the revolution. He also explained that the leadership of Hugo Chavez has been evolving. Chavez began his presidency on the basis of democratic demands and by standing against “neo-liberal capitalism”, and has now moved to an anti-imperialist position. He recently pointed out that the root cause of the problems of the Venezuelan people was capitalism, and that the only solution to these problems was the establishment of a socialist society – a genuine socialist society. An anti-globalisation activist also took the platform and gave a first hand report of her experiences at the World Social Forum where Chavez met with activists and trade unionists from all over the world. The interest in what is happening in Venezuela was so big that even after the meeting was officially over the discussion continued.

			Ricardo Galindez speaking tour kicks off with big success in British House of Commons:""We Will Win!""",2005-02-03T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Rob Sewell","Ricardo Galindez’s tour of Britain kicked off with a big success yesterday. Over 80 people filled the Grand Committee Rooms in the British House of Commons to hear the Venezuelan trade union leader outline the latest developments in the Bolivarian Revolution. The meeting was sponsored by John McDonnell MP, the honorary President of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and chaired by Jeremy Dear, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists. John McDonnell opened the meeting by explaining the vital importance of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign in raising the issue of the Venezuelan revolution throughout the labour movement. In particular, in this general election year, it was essential to put pressure on Labour MPs and through them on the Labour government. “In the past we supported the cause of revolutions that had been crushed by imperialism, now we have a chance of supporting a revolution in the making”, he said. Ricardo Galindez spoke of his experiences in the fast moving events of the Venezuelan Revolution. He explained the masses, aroused by the election of Hugo Chavez, had faced up to every challenge, including the recent Referendum, to deal a blow to the counter-revolution and the rule of the oligarchy. “On the day of the Referendum, the Opposition suffered a serious blow”, he said. “It was produced by the strength of the masses and introduced profound demoralisation into the ranks of the Opposition. They disappeared from the streets.” However, Ricardo warned that the counter-revolution would never give up. “They continue to conspire and plot. They keep factories closed.” They were behind the recent assassination of the prosecutor investigating the coup organisers. Ricardo then explained that the recent kidnapping of the FARC representative in Caracas by Colombian special forces in alliance with some Venezuelan military officials was a provocation, behind which lies the hand of Washington. He went on to explain that the UNT was a growing force. The working class has put its stamp on the revolution and the nationalisation of Venepal was a “turning-point”, so he said. Ricardo welcomed the comments of President Chavez in explaining that the Bolivarian revolution could not remain within the confines of capitalism. Only by taking the socialist road and nationalising the banks, finance houses and major companies can we succeed. He warned, however, that the revolution is not complete. To avoid defeat it must go forward and break the power of the oligarchy by nationalising their property and placing it under workers’ control. Comrade Galindez ended his speech with the words: “We shall win. We have got to win. We WILL win!” The next speaker was the Venezuelan Ambassador to London, Alfredo Toro Hardy. He explained that President Chavez was well aware of the fine work of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign in Britain. “In fact, I spoke to President Chavez a few days ago and he was keen to make a short stop-over visit to Britain to meet with you”, stated Mr Hardy to rapturous applause. The Ambassador outlined the policies of the Chavez government and the grave difficulties Venezuela faced from the aggressive stance of the United States. Hugo Chavez had won 8 different electoral processes in addition to his presidential election in 1998, and yet the hostile media are calling him a dictator! The model of free-market capitalism that the United States is attempting to impose on Latin America has been a disaster, he said. Latin American indicators are worse in the 1990s than in the 1970s. “The model advocated by President Chavez is rational”, he explained. He ended his speech with the appeal: “We need your help.” Comrade Manzoor, member of the Pakistani Parliament, and who met President Chavez in Venezuela last year, also addressed the meeting. In his contribution, he drew comparisons between the Bolivarian Revolution and the revolution in Pakistan in 1969. In Pakistan, the revolution under the leadership of Bhutto, went half way, and resulted in the counter-revolution being able to muster its forces and overthrow Bhutto in a military coup. The conclusion he drew was that it is necessary to carry through the socialist revolution to the very end. There was no other road, stated Manzoor. A lively period of questions and discussion followed from the floor. A collection was also held which raised an excellent £150 for the funds of the campaign. After a brief reply from the Ambassador and Ricardo, Jeremy Dear summed up the meeting and appealed for the Campaign to be raised in every corner of the labour movement. He also expressed his deep appreciation to John McDonnell for his help, which was also heartily appreciated by thunderous applause from the audience. Once again, the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign has held a successful meeting in the House of Commons. The task now is to take the Campaign to every trade union branch, every trades council, every shop stewards’ meeting and every student union, to build it into a mass movement in defence of the Venezuelan Revolution. Ricardo Galindez’s tour of Britain kicked off with a big success yesterday. Over 80 people filled the Grand Committee Rooms in the British House of Commons to hear the Venezuelan trade union leader outline the latest developments in the Bolivarian Revolution. The meeting was sponsored by John McDonnell MP, the honorary President of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign and chaired by Jeremy Dear, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists. John McDonnell opened the meeting by explaining the vital importance of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign in raising the issue of the Venezuelan revolution throughout the labour movement. In particular, in this general election year, it was essential to put pressure on Labour MPs and through them on the Labour government. “In the past we supported the cause of revolutions that had been crushed by imperialism, now we have a chance of supporting a revolution in the making”, he said. Ricardo Galindez spoke of his experiences in the fast moving events of the Venezuelan Revolution. He explained the masses, aroused by the election of Hugo Chavez, had faced up to every challenge, including the recent Referendum, to deal a blow to the counter-revolution and the rule of the oligarchy. “On the day of the Referendum, the Opposition suffered a serious blow”, he said. “It was produced by the strength of the masses and introduced profound demoralisation into the ranks of the Opposition. They disappeared from the streets.” However, Ricardo warned that the counter-revolution would never give up. “They continue to conspire and plot. They keep factories closed.” They were behind the recent assassination of the prosecutor investigating the coup organisers. Ricardo then explained that the recent kidnapping of the FARC representative in Caracas by Colombian special forces in alliance with some Venezuelan military officials was a provocation, behind which lies the hand of Washington. He went on to explain that the UNT was a growing force. The working class has put its stamp on the revolution and the nationalisation of Venepal was a “turning-point”, so he said. Ricardo welcomed the comments of President Chavez in explaining that the Bolivarian revolution could not remain within the confines of capitalism. Only by taking the socialist road and nationalising the banks, finance houses and major companies can we succeed. He warned, however, that the revolution is not complete. To avoid defeat it must go forward and break the power of the oligarchy by nationalising their property and placing it under workers’ control. Comrade Galindez ended his speech with the words: “We shall win. We have got to win. We WILL win!” The next speaker was the Venezuelan Ambassador to London, Alfredo Toro Hardy. He explained that President Chavez was well aware of the fine work of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign in Britain. “In fact, I spoke to President Chavez a few days ago and he was keen to make a short stop-over visit to Britain to meet with you”, stated Mr Hardy to rapturous applause.

			Venezuelan trade unionist Ricardo Galindez comes to Britain and Ireland!",2005-01-28T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Ramon Sanchez","The supporters of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign are going to start the New Year in the same way as they finished 2004 – by raising the profile of the Venezuelan Revolution. In December 2004 Hands Off Venezuela supporters in London organised a speaking tour for Oscar Negrin , who is the head teacher of a school in Caracas occupied by the pupils and the community as a response to the bosses’ lockout of December 2002. In February Hands Off Venezuela supporters are hosting the Venezuelan trade unionist and Marxist, Ricardo Galindez. This comrade, originally from Barquisimeto, has been the editor of the socialist journal El Topo Obrero for more than 20 years. He has participated in the revolutionary process since the very beginning. His involvement in left-wing politics cost him the hatred of the bosses in the state of Lara and a bullet in his chest that almost killed him . That was not the only time that the bosses’ thugs picked on him. He was also on the front line during the creation of the UNT. From the very first moment he pushed for resolutions outlining the anti-capitalist nature and militant approach of the new Venezuelan trade union. In February labour movement activists and youth in London, Cambridge and Dublin will have the chance to hear a first hand report of what is going on in Venezuela at the moment. Hands Off Venezuela is aiming to extend solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution across the left. Galindez is going to meet students, trade union activists, progressive MPs and anti-war activists during the 10 days he will be spending in Britain and Ireland. This is a very interesting moment for the Venezuelan Revolution. On the one hand occupied factories like Venepal are raising the question ""who runs the country?"" and demonstrating to everybody that bosses are not necessary to run society. Galindez is a leading figure in the solidarity committee with the Venepal workers. On the other hand, Chavez is accelerating the process of land reform. This process of speeding up the land reform has been stirred up by the intervention at “El Charcote”. This is a cattle ranch owned by the British company Vestey Group Ltd. This intervention is the first in a chain of 15 landed estate interventions in the state of Cojedes alone. This measure attacks the interests of the Venezuelan oligarchy, which has continually plotted against the Venezuelan Revolution head on. All of us will have the chance to discuss all these issues with Ricardo Galindez, and find out what more can be done to support the Venezuelan revolution.

			Appeal for the 16th World Festival of Students and Youth in Caracas, August 5-13th, 2005",2004-12-29T00:00:00Z,NA,"With the change in the balance of forces in the world, the imperialist powers have increased their aggression while becoming increasingly unified in their attacks against humanity and our natural resources. In order to preserve and deepen their hegemony, U.S. imperialism and its allies launched a military crusade against whomever stood in their way under the cover of the so-called ""War on Terror"" and the threat of weapons of mass destruction. This policy has resulted in the occupation of Iraq, continuous aggression against Palestine and the economic blockade and threats against Cuba, Venezuela, DPRK and Syria. It has further caused suffering in Africa in countries such as Western Sahara, Sudan and Zimbabwe by imposing sanctions and internal interference. The real face of aggression, injustice and barbarism has led to the militarization of societies and their economies against people's well being. Young people around the world have been seriously victimized by the effects of imperialist and neo-liberal policies of international institutions such as the IMF, WTO, G-8, European Union and World Bank. At the same time the gap between the rich and the poor, the developed and undeveloped countries grows wider. Exploitation, hunger, unemployment, lack of health care, poverty, and misery continue to grow as a result of the imperialist economic, political and military policies, resulting in catastrophic effects for millions of people around the world. In various forms, and throughout the world, youth have fought exploitation, blockades, embargos, sanctions, racial discrimination, and xenophobia. We struggle for peace, national sovereignty, independence, self-determination, democracy, security, international solidarity and a world free from nuclear weapons. We demand respect for and the defense of human and democratic rights, social justice, women's rights, sustainable development and the environment. We demand that everyone have access to employment with dignity, labor rights, education, health care, sport, culture and technology. The World Festival of Youth and Students (WFYS), initiated in 1947, is the biggest event organized by progressive and democratic youth and students around the world. The WFYS is one of the main expressions of anti-imperialist, anti-fascist and anti-colonialist struggles led by youth. After the successful 15th WFYS in Algeria in 2001, held for the first time on the African continent and Arab region, the 16th WFYS will take place in Caracas, Venezuela, from August 5 to 13, 2005. The 16th WFYS in Venezuela affirms and reinforces the Festival's character and orientation as an international, anti-imperialist, political-cultural, and broad-based mass event of youth and students. This also provides an opportunity to extend our solidarity to the youth and people of Venezuela, its Bolivarian Revolution and all the people struggling all over the world. The 16th WFYS should continue to reflect the diversity and richness of all the expressions of the international youth and student movements that are committed to the character and spirit of the Festival, as well as their struggles and demands. The Festival will be a space to exchange ideas and experiences and provide a platform to coordinate our efforts and intensify the struggles in our respective countries. The 16th WFYS is a great moment to strengthen our efforts on the basis of a common cause and interests in the intensifying struggle against imperialism. We appeal to all youth and students to join in this struggle and work actively to participate in and strengthen the 16th WFYS. For Peace and Solidarity, We struggle against Imperialism and War! Let us work for a successful 16th World Festival of Youth and Students in Caracas, Venezuela. Brasilia, Brazil, June 2004 U.S. Update - there will be a regional meeting of the NPC in Chicago on Feb.12 sign up for more information below. Update for the 16th World Festival of Students and Youth to be held in Caracas Venezuela on August 5th-13th The U.S. Preparatory Committee meeting for the 16th WFSY in NYC was a success, about 37 people attended with another 6 or 7 on a national phone hookup. Many different groups were their and lots of issues were discussed. An interim Steering Committee was setup consisting of: Bolivarian Circle ""Professor Alberto Lovera"" Hands Off Venezuela Campaign YSA YCL Choice U.S.A. F.I.S.T. United States Student Assoc. Venceremos Brigade Indymedia SGAA- student government group at MBCC Republic of New Africa Fortune People and groups took up committees to work on Outreach/Education, Fundraising and logistics. The group endorses the idea that it should be broad-based, inclusive, diverse and youth with many solidarity and other issues. One added item was since this event is taking place in Venezuela and that the deepening of the Bolivarian Revolution is taking place that its grassroots should be studied and supported not just in word. The next meeting of this group will be held in Chicago on Feb.12th and one of the Bolivarian comrades will be their to help put it together.

			Extraordinary meeting of Chavez with workers in Madrid",2004-11-23T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Emilia Lucena","It is nearly five o’clock. A shy autumn sun bathes the Prado Avenue on our way to the headquarters of the Workers’ Commissions (CCOO) in Madrid. When we arrive there are already more than 300 people queuing to get into the meeting hall. They patiently wait to attend the meeting with Chavez which is scheduled for 7 pm. There is chaos. Lope de Vega is a narrow street and more and more people arrive to attend the meeting. The hall stewards are overwhelmed, some of them surprised by the enormous expectation, some ask what is the matter with Chavez and some even ask who Chavez is (one mixes him up with Andalusia president Chaves). The police officers cannot understand and do not know what attitude to adopt. One of them tries to show that he is in charge, and demonstrates the usual arrogant and contemptuous attitude of the police, but nobody pays any notice. They are all either sufficiently happy or enthused with the perspective of meeting Chavez, and are not prepared to fall into any provocations. During the nearly two hour wait, the queue breaks into singing and shouting of slogans in defence of the Venezuelan revolution and its president. It is nearly 7pm when the doors open, and the human tide is allowed in, in groups of five. We must go through a metal detector. It is just four days since the State Prosecutor investigating those involved in the April 11 coup has died, assassinated in a terrorist attack carried out by the forces of reaction. Nobody complains. We all understand the need to take all necessary security measures. We are aware that the international counter-revolution has set its sights on Chavez. Slowly the meeting hall fills up. There is the shouting of slogans and the singing of songs. We are shown a video of the revolution. Some singers and musicians go on stage to entertain the people before Chavez’s arrival. Amongst them are the extraordinary Olga Manzano and Quintin Cabrera, but also many others, who do not feature in the commercial music scene, but want to show their solidarity and sympathy for the revolution. Of course, [Spanish singer] Alejandro Sanz, the gusano who said that Chavez should resign because the people of Venezuela were against him, and who has now been shut up by the results of the recall referendum, is not there. A terrible moment. It is announced that the president will not come. It is half past eight. The audience is stunned. Disillusionment runs through all those present, but it is agreed that the meeting will continue. We want to show our support for the revolution, but the mood has changed from one of enthusiasm to a disheartened one. We wanted to listen to Chavez, the leader of the Venezuelan revolution. William Lara, the former president of the Venezuelan National Assembly and Member of Parliament, addresses the audience. His speech does not connect. He says that Venezuela is a paradise for investment from Spanish businesses. There is a stunned, and a little bit of an angry silence. These are the same businesses that exploit us day in and day out. These are the same businesses that hire young people and immigrant workers as cheap labour without rights, and demand more flexibility for wages and working conditions! We know they are not going to create wealth in Venezuela, in the same way they do not create wealth for the people here. William Lara continues with his speech and at the end adds, like an afterthought, that this investment will not have the same exploitive character as in the past. The question everybody is asking themselves is: does William Lara really know what employers are? Does he know that their profits come from our exploitation? Does he realize that they will not invest a single cent unless they have a firm guarantee that they will recover their investment tenfold by keeping the majority of the population in poverty? While Lara speaks a rumour makes the rounds: “Chavez is coming”, first it is just in the front rows, then moves throughout the hall. Nobody pays much attention to anything apart from whether Chavez is coming or not. From the stage nothing is said about this, William Lara continues to speak. At the end a powerful voice from the audience says: “Chavez is coming”. There is a spontaneous ovation. The mood is cheerful again. Now the musicians go on stage and we all sing along and clap to the songs. Later we found out what had happened. A group of people, led by Manolo Espinar of the Haydee Santamaria organisationa and JM Municio from El Militante, had gone to the Circulo de Bellas Artes, where Chavez was meeting a group of intellectuals and actors, and explained to him that 1500 workers and youth were waiting for him in the CCOO meeting hall. And they managed to bring him along! When Chavez found out that we were waiting, he did not hesitate: “I am going over there, even if it is just to give a 15 minute greeting”. As he himself said later: “thank you, you have rescued me from the intellectuals to bring me to the workers”. The hours go by and he still does not arrive. The banners in the hall still speak solidarity from the walls. Amongst them is one from El Militante and the Sindicato de Estudiantes (Spanish Students Union) which reads: “Venepal: nationalization under workers control”. Nobody leaves. Now and then the news is confirmed: despite the delay, Chavez is coming. We are waiting. Messages of support are read to the meeting. At the beginning two were read from the Alliance of Anti-imperialist Intellectuals and another one from Culture against War. Then they read the one from the Sindicato de Estudiantes, which was interrupted by ovations twice. Then, in between the songs, others are read: from the Communist Party, the Red Current, El Militante, the international Hands Off Venezuela Campaign ... We sing some songs and then The Internationale. The whole room has raised fists as the Internationale comes out of our throats like the shout of revolutionary struggle, solidarity and proletarian internationalism. At last, at 10:30 pm, after waiting for more than 5 hours, Chavez arrives! The enthusiasm is overwhelming. There is a standing ovation and raised fists as we greet him. He is standing on stage. He is obviously tired but also moved by the greeting and the enthusiasm overfilling the hall. He apologises for the delay, and starts by reciting a poem by [Spanish revolutionary poet] Garcia Lorca. He begins to address the crowd. He talks about the revolution, the oppressed, the oligarchy and imperialism that organized the coup in April 2002, how he thought he was going to be shot dead, and how the soldiers, arms in hand, avoided it. “There, facing the death squad, I though of Che (...) how men die”. He explains how thousands and thousands of workers, the poor, surrounded the Miraflores Palace defending the revolution. “They tried once and failed, and if they tried again they would fail again, because in Venezuela the arms are in the hands of the soldiers, who are part of the people”. He mentions the coup against Allende: “the Chilean revolution failed because it was a peaceful and unarmed revolution. The Bolivarian revolution is peaceful... but armed”. We understand very well what he is talking about. We also know about our own past. The audience begins to shout, fists raised again, “the people, armed, will never be smashed” (“el pueblo armado, jamás será aplastado”). Now he talks about the money from [state oil company] PDVSA, which is being used for social programs, and he mentions Cuba and the Cuban doctors. There is another standing ovation and shouts of “Chavez, Fidel y el Che”. He mentions the shipyard workers [fighting for months against the closure of the shipyards]. The whole audience shouts, “The shipyards will not be closed down!” He talks about the democratic revolution in Venezuela, of how the people support the revolution. He talks of the peoples of Latin America. “If Bolivar lived today, he would be a socialist”. He also mentions Marx. Incidentally, on his way in, he stopped to browse at the bookstall of El Militante. He spoke to the comrades. When he saw Alan Woods’ books he said: “Oh, Alan Woods. He is a friend of mine”. We want to give him the books he has chosen as a present, amongst them several by Alan Woods, Ted Grant and Trotsky, but he insists he wants to pay for them. At the end he accepts Alan Woods’ “Bolshevism, the road to revolution” as a gift. He now talks about the workers and the need for unity. “There is a socialist international and a Christian Democratic international. Why can’t we form a democratic and revolutionary international? Unite all the oppressed peoples, the workers, the indigenous peoples ...”. There is another standing ovation. He develops the idea: “the working class must be the vanguard of the revolution (...) It should not only concern itself with immediate or wage demands, which are necessary and must be fought for, but it must also look beyond, to the transformation of society as a whole”. The enthusiasm is overwhelming. “Long live the working class”, and “the working class has no borders” are slogans which become alive and are shouted by the whole audience as one. During the speech, standing up, he has been given cups of coffee which he drank. It has been a very packed day. He was at the Complutense University, where the students also received him with enthusiasm, surpassing all expectations. He met with Zapatero, with artists and intellectuals in the Circulo de Bellas Artes, and then at 10:30 pm he met with the workers... The best part of it, he snubbed a meeting with big business. Today the media complain and say this is not acceptable because he snubbed a meeting with 200 “business leaders”. Today, workers understand more who Chavez is and the support he receives from Venezuelan workers. It is past 11:30 and finally he says goodbye. As he leaves the hall, as when he came in, there is a standing ovation. We are all shouting, “the revolution forward, forward, and those who do not like it, will have to stand it” (“La revolución p’alante, p’alante y al que no le guste que se joda y que se aguante”.) As always, everywhere he goes, this enthusiasm is also expressed in the desire to get close to him, to greet him personally. Despite the bodyguards and the security measures, when he comes out he is surrounded by a sea of hands showing their solidarity and support for the Venezuelan revolution. He is extremely polite, tactful and educated, and in an impossible attempt, he tries to greet and talk to all those who come close to him. He understands that this show of solidarity reflects the desire of workers to show, through him, to the workers and the oppressed in Venezuela, the hopes that their revolution has raised amongst workers and youth around the world.

There is another standing ovation and shouts of “Chavez, Fidel y el Che”. He mentions the shipyard workers [fighting for months against the closure of the shipyards]. The whole audience shouts, “The shipyards will not be closed down!” He talks about the democratic revolution in Venezuela, of how the people support the revolution. He talks of the peoples of Latin America. “If Bolivar lived today, he would be a socialist”. He also mentions Marx. Incidentally, on his way in, he stopped to browse at the bookstall of El Militante. He spoke to the comrades. When he saw Alan Woods’ books he said: “Oh, Alan Woods. He is a friend of mine”. We want to give him the books he has chosen as a present, amongst them several by Alan Woods, Ted Grant and Trotsky, but he insists he wants to pay for them. At the end he accepts Alan Woods’ “Bolshevism, the road to revolution” as a gift. He now talks about the workers and the need for unity. “There is a socialist international and a Christian Democratic international. Why can’t we form a democratic and revolutionary international? Unite all the oppressed peoples, the workers, the indigenous peoples ...”. There is another standing ovation. He develops the idea: “the working class must be the vanguard of the revolution (...) It should not only concern itself with immediate or wage demands, which are necessary and must be fought for, but it must also look beyond, to the transformation of society as a whole”. The enthusiasm is overwhelming. “Long live the working class”, and “the working class has no borders” are slogans which become alive and are shouted by the whole audience as one. During the speech, standing up, he has been given cups of coffee which he drank. It has been a very packed day. He was at the Complutense University, where the students also received him with enthusiasm, surpassing all expectations. He met with Zapatero, with artists and intellectuals in the Circulo de Bellas Artes, and then at 10:30 pm he met with the workers... The best part of it, he snubbed a meeting with big business. Today the media complain and say this is not acceptable because he snubbed a meeting with 200 “business leaders”. Today, workers understand more who Chavez is and the support he receives from Venezuelan workers. It is past 11:30 and finally he says goodbye. As he leaves the hall, as when he came in, there is a standing ovation. We are all shouting, “the revolution forward, forward, and those who do not like it, will have to stand it” (“La revolución p’alante, p’alante y al que no le guste que se joda y que se aguante”.) As always, everywhere he goes, this enthusiasm is also expressed in the desire to get close to him, to greet him personally. Despite the bodyguards and the security measures, when he comes out he is surrounded by a sea of hands showing their solidarity and support for the Venezuelan revolution. He is extremely polite, tactful and educated, and in an impossible attempt, he tries to greet and talk to all those who come close to him. He understands that this show of solidarity reflects the desire of workers to show, through him, to the workers and the oppressed in Venezuela, the hopes that their revolution has raised amongst workers and youth around the world.

Anderson was trained to ""follow the money"", and had traced millions of dollars from the US government to coup-plotters.

													Hands Off Venezuela","The Austrian Marxists of “Der Funke” eagerly took up the appeal of the “Hands off Venezuela” campaign right from when it was launched and started to organise a series of activities in solidarity with the movement of our brothers and sisters in Venezuela. They sent us the following report. “During the bosses lockout in 2002/2003 in Venezuela (the so-called oil workers’ strike) we moved a resolution at the national congress of the Socialist Youth, condemning this counterrevolutionary act and calling for international solidarity. The more then 200 delegates at the congress unanimously voted in favour of the resolution. Ever since then the revolutionary process in Venezuela has regularly been covered in our publications. In January of this year we finally succeeded in organising a speaking-tour with Herman Albrecht of the “Corriente Marxista Revolucionaria”. At seven meetings in five cities Herman explained the situation of the movement especially highlighting the occupied factories. Taking up the “Hands off Venezuela” appeal of the “In Defence of Marxism” website we launched the initiative in branches, meetings or conferences of working-class organisations - in the Socialist Youth, Trade Unions and Social Democratic Party. So we are making sure that the call to stop imperialist intervention is widely heard in the movement. Many ordinary workers and youth, but also shop stewards and high-ranking party and TU officials, decided so to help the campaign by signing the appeal. In several organisations comrades called for more information, so we are going to organise discussions, film nights etc., on the situation in Venezuela. As part of this ongoing campaign comrades from various YS and TU branches in Vienna gathered at the embassy of the Bolivarian Republic to loudly express their protest against imperialist manoeuvres and to show their solidarity with the revolutionary movement. Miriam Garcia de Perez, Deputy Ambassador of the Bolivarian Republic, joined the gathering for a moment, stating that the government is willing to take up the fight for its national sovereignty and expressed her gratitude for this international campaign. Her “tropical greetings” went especially to the 30 people in Vienna who despite an icy winter rain showed up to the gathering and stayed for more then one hour on the street in front of the embassy. History shows that without a conscious Marxist leadership the revolution will fail, as our enemies are prepared to use any mistake of the movement to regain control over the situation. As conscious internationalists and revolutionaries we are well aware that the further deepening of the revolution in Venezuela would become an example for the working-class on a worldwide level. As Gustavo Adolfo Marquez Marin, the Ambassador of Venezuela in Austria put it: “Our country is in the eye of the hurricane.” All decent humans want to see an end to this hurricane of misery, wars and barbarism on a worldwide scale. Let us start from Venezuela!” - Editorial Board Der Funke, March 25 2004 In Italy a delegation from HOV, coordinated by FalceMartello visited the Venezuelan Consulate in Milan. The Consul (Antonieta Arcaya Smith) is very much in support of Chavez. She expressed her interest in the ""Hands off Venezuela"" campaign, especially after they mentioned the fact that last Sunday Chavez dedicated 20 minutes in his Alo Presidente TV programme explaining what the campaign was about and who was organising it. They asked for her support for the campaign, and particularly for a speaking tour they are planning at the end of April. She said there would be no problem in advertising our meeting through the consulate. In the conversation they had with the Consul she expressed great satisfaction at receiving such acts of solidarity. In the next few days our comrades will go to the embassy in Rome and to the consulate in Naples. They are also in touch with Bolivarian circles in Florence and Rome. They are very keen to organise something with us. This is all part of the build up for their solidarity campaign which will consist of a speaking tour at the end of April and all the comrades are very enthusiastic. In the United States the Venezuelan Deputy Consul General in San Francisco, Jose Egidio Rodriguez met with one of the coordinators of the HOV, for a meeting. Our statements on Venezuela, solidarity signatures and a copy of the US Socialist Appeal were handed to him. The discussion centred on the international HOV solidarity with the Revolution. He expressed our support for the right of the Venezuelan people to defend themselves against US intervention. The conversations also covered such issues as the trade unions in the USA, the events in Spain, Healthcare, our tendency's (In Defence of Marxism) history, the Socialist Parties, the Communist Parties, the upcoming election for President, and even a brief chat about baseball! The Deputy Consul General thanked us for our support. Supporters of the HOV in other parts of the USA are considering visiting their local Venezuelan Consulates/Embassies. Across the Ocean from San Francisco, in Australia , supporters of the HOV visited the Venezuelan Embassy in Canberra and were received very cordially by the Ambassador who was very supportive of any effort to build a solidarity campaign. In Mexico the supporters of the Militante journal, together with CEDEP (Committees in Defence of State Education) and CoTDeSi (Workers’ Committee in Defence of the Trade Union) went to the Venezuelan Embassy to express their solidarity with the Venezuelan workers and with the revolutionary process. They expressed their concern at US interference in the process and condemned US imperialism’s manoeuvres in backing attempts to undermine the authority of the CEN (National Electoral Council) in Venezuela. The comrades read out the statements of Militante , Cedep and Cotdesi . A delegation was received by the comrade Ambassador, Lino Martínez Salazar, a man with a long history of struggle in defence of workers’ rights in Venezuela. A resolution calling on US imperialism to keep its hands off Venezuela, signed by 354 youth, lecturers and workers, in various colleges and unions was handed to the Ambassador. Another resolution voted by 140 rank and file activists of the PRD at a conference held on March 21-22 was also handed in. A copy of the Mexican edition of Alan Woods’ book, Bolsehvism, the road to revolution, was given to the Ambassador. The event was rounded off with the chanting of several anti-imperialist slogans and the singing of the Internationale. For a more complete account of the event see the report at: where you will also find photos of the events . In Belgium the ‘Hands off Venezuela’ campaign has been contacted by Venezuelans in the Netherlands . They have a website dedicated to defending the Bolivarian Revolution in the Netherlands, on which they publish material from In Defence of Marxism in Dutch. They are very grateful for our support for the revolutionary process in Venezuela. The supporters of Vonk , who are coordinating the HOV in Belgium, will be talking to the Venezuelan Ambassador tomorrow. In Britain , the following day, on Wednesday March 24, a meeting was held in the House of Commons to speak out against the smoke screen that the mass media has created to obscure the issue of the Venezuelan revolution. The meeting, organised by left Labour MP John McDonnell – who is a supporter of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign – was used to publicise and explain the Early Day Motion (EDM 854) being introduced into Parliament. An Early Day Motion is a motion with no fixed date for debate. In reality, it is a device used to draw attention to a particular issue and to elicit support by inviting other MPs to add their signatures to it. Most are never actually debated. So far 20 MPs have added their names to this motion. EDM 854 puts a heavy emphasis on the position of women in Venezuela – which is indeed a very important question – at least partly because it was originally put forward by a group called Global Women’s strike. Pablo Sanchez addressed the meeting on behalf of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The audience consisting of around 30 people showed a great deal of interest in developing a campaign in Britain to support the revolutionary movement in Venezuela. Alan Simpson MP (Labour), Secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs agreed to sponsor the campaign and to canvass for further support in Parliament. This is an important step in building support in the British labour movement for the revolutionary process in Venezuela and against the intrigues of US imperialism. In a further development, this weekend the national conference of the National Union of Journalists – whose General Secretary, Jeremy Dear, is a sponsor of the campaign – will discuss a motion to support the new Venezuelan trade union, the UNT. Also, the AMICUS London General Industries Sector Conference 2004 passed a resolution presented by Espe Espigares, a delegate from Branch 974, condemning US interference in Venezuela. The text of the resolution reads as follows: “This conference deplores the intents of the United States to intervene in the internal life of Venezuela. Two attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez and behind these attempts has been the hand of the CIA. Conference pledges its support to the revolutionary movement of the Venezuelan people in their struggle for socialist equality and justice. Furthermore, Conference pledges support to the 'Hands off Venezuela' campaign which seeks to promote the awareness of what is happening in Venezuela.” The Austrian Marxists of “Der Funke” eagerly took up the appeal of the “Hands off Venezuela” campaign right from when it was launched and started to organise a series of activities in solidarity with the movement of our brothers and sisters in Venezuela.

The comrades read out the statements of Militante , Cedep and Cotdesi . A delegation was received by the comrade Ambassador, Lino Martínez Salazar, a man with a long history of struggle in defence of workers’ rights in Venezuela. A resolution calling on US imperialism to keep its hands off Venezuela, signed by 354 youth, lecturers and workers, in various colleges and unions was handed to the Ambassador. Another resolution voted by 140 rank and file activists of the PRD at a conference held on March 21-22 was also handed in. A copy of the Mexican edition of Alan Woods’ book, Bolsehvism, the road to revolution, was given to the Ambassador. The event was rounded off with the chanting of several anti-imperialist slogans and the singing of the Internationale. For a more complete account of the event see the report at: where you will also find photos of the events . In Belgium the ‘Hands off Venezuela’ campaign has been contacted by Venezuelans in the Netherlands . They have a website dedicated to defending the Bolivarian Revolution in the Netherlands, on which they publish material from In Defence of Marxism in Dutch. They are very grateful for our support for the revolutionary process in Venezuela. The supporters of Vonk , who are coordinating the HOV in Belgium, will be talking to the Venezuelan Ambassador tomorrow. In Britain , the following day, on Wednesday March 24, a meeting was held in the House of Commons to speak out against the smoke screen that the mass media has created to obscure the issue of the Venezuelan revolution. The meeting, organised by left Labour MP John McDonnell – who is a supporter of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign – was used to publicise and explain the Early Day Motion (EDM 854) being introduced into Parliament. An Early Day Motion is a motion with no fixed date for debate. In reality, it is a device used to draw attention to a particular issue and to elicit support by inviting other MPs to add their signatures to it. Most are never actually debated. So far 20 MPs have added their names to this motion. EDM 854 puts a heavy emphasis on the position of women in Venezuela – which is indeed a very important question – at least partly because it was originally put forward by a group called Global Women’s strike. Pablo Sanchez addressed the meeting on behalf of the Hands Off Venezuela Campaign. The audience consisting of around 30 people showed a great deal of interest in developing a campaign in Britain to support the revolutionary movement in Venezuela. Alan Simpson MP (Labour), Secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs agreed to sponsor the campaign and to canvass for further support in Parliament. This is an important step in building support in the British labour movement for the revolutionary process in Venezuela and against the intrigues of US imperialism. In a further development, this weekend the national conference of the National Union of Journalists – whose General Secretary, Jeremy Dear, is a sponsor of the campaign – will discuss a motion to support the new Venezuelan trade union, the UNT. Also, the AMICUS London General Industries Sector Conference 2004 passed a resolution presented by Espe Espigares, a delegate from Branch 974, condemning US interference in Venezuela. The text of the resolution reads as follows: “This conference deplores the intents of the United States to intervene in the internal life of Venezuela. Two attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez and behind these attempts has been the hand of the CIA. Conference pledges its support to the revolutionary movement of the Venezuelan people in their struggle for socialist equality and justice. Furthermore, Conference pledges support to the 'Hands off Venezuela' campaign which seeks to promote the awareness of what is happening in Venezuela.”",Austria Italy United States Australia Mexico Belgium Netherlands Vonk Britain Austria Italy United States Australia Mexico Belgium Netherlands Vonk Britain,NA

			ESF meeting on Venezuela and the Bolivarian revolution",2004-10-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HoV","Yesterday, October 17, In Defence of Marxism and the Hands Off Venezuela campaign organised a meeting on Venezuela and the Bolivarian revolution at the European Social Forum in London. Despite the fact that this important workshop had been relegated to an early Sunday morning, nearly 70 people turned up to hear Alan Woods, editor of Marxist.com, and Jorge Martin, on behalf of the Hands off Venezuela Campaign, speak on the events in Venezuela. The room was packed with young people and trade unionists from all over the world. Before dealing with the actual subject, Jorge Martin started his speech with a reference to the organisation of this year’s European Social Forum. Not enough attention had been paid to the subject of Venezuela, which is now one of the most important developments in the whole world. It is a real pity that no seminar could be organised as this meant that no simultaneous translation was available. Having said that, Jorge turned to the reason behind the setting up of the Hands off Venezuela Campaign. The campaign had been started mainly to counter the vicious media blockade on the subject of Venezuela. On really significant events like the Bolivarian Revolution there is a wall of silence on the part of the Western media. Even worse, when they do refer to Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, he is nearly always portrayed as an authoritarian former army general, not as a democratically elected president who has won in seven different electoral processes. Jorge Martin recalled a striking anecdote on the media lies. He was on his way to Caracas in an Air France airplane. Reading the Spanish daily El Pais , he read about Caracas being paralysed by a massive strike involving all important sectors of the economy, including the cancellation of all international flights. However, Jorge was flying precisely to Caracas and everything was perfectly normal there! Then he posed the question of the Bolivarian Revolution. Since there has been no fundamental economic transformation, why do we say that the events in Venezuela are of a revolutionary character? The main reason is the massive political awareness in the country. Contrary to most Western “democracies”, there is no apathy at all among the Venezuelan people. Everybody has an opinion on the political situation, either from the right or from the left. But above all, in the last years there has been massive participation of ordinary people and the poorer sections in society in politics. The recent recall referendum is proof of this. In other countries the participation level is always quite low, with only 40 or 50 percent of the people bothering to vote. Why would they vote if all politicians tell them the same things? In Venezuela, on the other hand, more than 90 percent of the people turn up to vote. This is because people can see that it does make a difference who is in power. After the election of Hugo Chavez huge literacy campaigns have been conducted. For the first time poor people have access to basic medical health care, and there has been significant land reform, etc. In short, after the 1998 election there has been a mass politicization. For the first time ordinary working people have a sense of dignity and now feel as real human beings. This is one of the most striking features when you travel to Venezuela and talk to people, Jorge said. They can see something has changed for the better and they want to maintain and extend these achievements. Precisely because of all the progressive reforms, Chavez has been able to maintain his support among a majority of the Venezuelan people. Not only one time, but in seven electoral contests! Compare that to the West, where one government after another is voted out of office. That is, of course, not to the liking of the so-called “Democratic Opposition”. They could not even stand his initially moderate reforms, and obviously could stand even less the subsequent more radical reforms. Hence their various attempts at overthrowing Chavez’s government by terrorist means, lock-outs and a coup. One criticism you can make of Chavez, Jorge told the audience, is not that he is authoritarian, but rather too lenient with the coup organisers. Those who pulled down a statue of Colombus on Columbus Day (October 12) were put in jail, but most of the organisers of the coup are still free and have been able to flee the country. Some are on trial now, two years after the coup, but Pedro Carmona has only been put under house arrest. As a result, he fled to Miami and is now organising the opposition. Carlos Andres Pérez, now living in the Dominican Republic, said that the only way to remove Chavez is by violent means. These kinds of scoundrels are still free and have been able to organise the terrorist campaign of last year. Jorge Martin then spoke on the trade union situation in Venezuela. The old CTV union has more than ever been discredited since its open support for the coup. Most of the workers have joined the new UNT, and what is more, they have done this on a radical program. The UNT is now the real trade union in Venezuela and its program includes workers’ control over the economy. This led Jorge to elaborate on this point. During last year’s lock-out there have been experiences of workers’ control. This was not in a small textile company, but in the oil industry, one of the biggest industries in the world! The oil company in Venezuela is indeed highly technological (with most processes being run by computer and satellite systems). The workers refused to take part in the lock-out of the bosses and were able to run the whole industry without the bosses. This proves that if workers can run such a complex industry then they can run anything. On that point, Jorge also mentioned the case of the Venepal workers and the need for solidarity. There is also the issue of the struggle between Venezuela and the United States. The US was interfering directly in Venezuela during the 2002 coup. They cannot tolerate a government that is an example to workers all over the world, especially the masses in their backyard, Mexico and Latin America. But Venezuela has some good trump cards, one of which is oil. Chavez has already threatened to cut off the oil supplies to the US if they interfere in their internal affairs. That would be an enormous blow, since Venezuela is the third biggest oil supplier to the US. “So what is the next step then?” Jorge asked. The oligarchy is demoralised and demobilised after they lost the referendum. The balance of forces is extremely favourable to the revolution. In the Bolivarian movements there have been numerous debates about the need for a revolution in the revolution, about the fight against bureaucracy. However, the state is still the same old state, with the same bureaucracy at the head of it. Jorge said you cannot take over a capitalist state and make it serve the interests of the people. Besides, some sections of the economy are still in private hands, most importantly the bank sector. Today two Spanish banks control the banking sector in Venezuela. The distribution of food and beverages is done privately, which enabled the opposition to paralyse the country during the lock-out by disrupting the supplies. Jorge continued by saying that some important battles have been won, but that this is a war over control of the economy. There are opposing class interests involved, and these have not been solved yet. Jorge used the analogy used by 19th century peasant war leader Ezequiel Zamora. In the course of the Federal War against the landed oligarchy, Zamora correctly said that “we must confiscate the property of the rich, since with it they make war against the people, we must leave them just with their shirts”. By way of conclusion, Jorge said we are living in very exciting times. To his knowledge there is no precedent of a successful military coup being defeated by the mass movement of working people once it has already been installed. This gives hope for the future – something can be done. Also, it is foolish to moderate your viewpoints for fear of provoking the enemy. The opposition and US imperialism have already been provoked, as the coup proves. The excuse often used by workers’ leaders that you can’t have a radical program that “scares away” the voters has been proved utterly wrong. In Venezuela there have been seven elections, and each of then have been won by the left-wing government. After Jorge Martin’s speech, the floor was given to Alan Woods. He started with the same observation that we live in very exciting times. Fifteen years ago the capitalists were euphoric because, so they claimed, “Socialism has been proven not to work”. They were talking about the end of socialism and communism, and some even dared to talk about the end of history. No change was possible in the best of possible worlds. But they merely proved to be utopians. Now there is instability in the whole of Latin America, Africa is in a horrible state, etc. But Venezuela shows that change is possible. Contrary to all the lies of the media, Hugo Chavez is not a dictator but an extremely popular president. The recall referendum once again proved that the majority of the Venezuelan people are standing behind their president. A recall referendum is in fact a very democratic mechanism, and Alan could think of several other leaders who would greatly benefit from the application of this mechanism! That is, George Bush, but also Tony Blair. The latter defied public opinion by lying over the motives for going to war in Iraq. The British people clearly said they didn’t want this war, and yet there is no way of removing Tony Blair from power. Alan Woods then went on to explain why the Bolivarian Revolution is indeed a revolution, contrary to what some left groups claim. Paraphrasing Leon Trotsky, he said: “The essence of a revolution is the direct intervention of the masses in the political life of the nation.” Millions of ordinary Venezuelan people began to move and started to take matters into their own hands. The indignation of the masses, who had suffered under 40 years of oppression and misery, was expressed in a peculiar way after the left-wing 1992 coup in the figure of Hugo Chavez. In 1998 he won the elections with an absolute majority. Eight years later, Chavez received 60 percent of the votes. How many governments in the world can claim this? After vividly describing the anger and mood of the masses, he firmly warned that the revolution has not been completed. The basic position of Marxists towards the Venezuelan revolution is to support it completely against foreign intervention. That is what Hands Off Venezuela is trying to do. But there is more to it. It is not possible to make half a revolution. What the referendum campaign has shown is that Venezuelan society is extremely polarised between right and left. The counterrevolutionaries are regrouping their forces and are preparing for a new offensive once the conditions are more favourable (most likely the 2006 elections). As long as the oligarchy continues to maintain its hold on important sections of the economy, it will continue to act as an agent of US imperialism, sabotaging and undermining the Bolivarian revolution. That is why the property of the counterrevolutionaries should be expropriated and the power of the landowners should be broken. Alan made an analogy with the American revolution, which took drastic measures against the landowners. Just as the American revolutionaries, the Venezuelan revolution should deal blows to the big landowners. The speech ended with an appeal. Not everything is fine and the revolution has not finished. Battles have been won, but not the war. The important point to stress is that everybody is able to do something. Alan appealed to the public saying that they can make a difference. Trade unionists can discuss the situation in their branches and pass resolutions recognising the new UNT trade union, other people can counter the numerous media lies. Above all, it is important to coordinate the different initiatives and set up Hands off Venezuela committees. Ramon Samblas then opened the meeting for questions and contributions from the audience. Somebody from the audience made the point that the solidarity campaign for Chile started after the 1973 coup and that it is better to start organising while the revolution is going on. “We have to learn the lessons of past solidarity campaigns. All of them have failed because they started too late.” He also said it was a real shame that Venezuela had not been discussed at a big session at the European Social Forum. Other contributions came among others from a young Norwegian trade unionist and Henry Suarez, professor of History at Caracas Central University. The general conclusion of the meeting was that we must defend the Bolivarian Revolution unconditionally. However, it is also necessary to deepen the political analysis of the Venezuelan revolution and the way forward. Only by learning the lessons of past defeats can we guarantee victory this time. Yesterday, October 17, In Defence of Marxism and the Hands Off Venezuela campaign organised a meeting on Venezuela and the Bolivarian revolution at the European Social Forum in London.

Demonstrators met and called for the withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan, for Germany’s exit from NATO, and against the Agenda 2010. There were 12 speakers at the demonstration in Wiesbaden, one of which was Hans-Gerd Öffinger, vice regional Chairman of the trade union Ver.di, and editor of the Marxist journal Der Dunke who spoke on the situation in Venezuela. The German Marxists of Der Funke participated in the events in Wiesbaden and Frankfurt with a bookstall selling Marxist literature and collecting signatures for the Hands off Venezuela Campaign . Hans-Gerd Öffinger spoke at the demonstration in Wiesbaden about US imperialism in Iraq and how the Bush administration is following the dictates of the oil industry. A lot of his speech was devoted to the situation in Venezuela, one of the world’s major exporters of oil, and consequently an important country for the interests of US imperialism. US imperialism has interfered directly in Iraq and they have also been interfering in a more indirect manner in Venezuela and have thus far been involved in organizing two attempted coup d’etats against President Chavez. This explains the assertions from the Bush administration that President Hugo Chavez supports guerillas and terrorists in Colombia and explains the interference of US imperialism in the country as a possible excuse for further intervention. The assertion that Chavez supports terrorists is a complete lie and fabrication – like the fairy tale of the danger of the Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq. The working class must struggle against imperialism everywhere. The methods of imperialism can also be seen in Germany. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s Agenda 2010 can be seen as “declaration of war against the German people” and must fought against, as we must struggle against imperialism in Iraq and Venezuela. Policies like the Agenda 2010 show that the foreign policy is the continuation of the policy at home. Hans-Gerd Öffinger’s speech was well received and found an echo in the press, getting mention in the largest local paper.

			British MPs condemn murder of Venezuelan prosecutor Danilo Anderson",2004-11-25T00:00:00Z,"
															
													Hands Off Venezuela","The left wing Labour Member of Parliament John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion condemning the murder of Danilo Anderson, the Venezuelan prosecutor investigating the April 2002 military coup against president Chavez (see Prosecutor investigating anti-Chavez coup killed in terrorist attack ). John McDonnell has been a vocal supporter and collaborator of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign from the very beginning (see Successful Hands Off Venezuela meeting at Portcullis House (London, UK) ). The motion comes after another motion also moved by John McDonnell on November 17th ( EDM 854 ), which also condemned US interference in Venezuela and its efforts to remove the democratically elected president Hugo Chavez. On the House of Commons web site you can see the full text of the November 17 th motion and the list of thirty-two MPs who signed: EDM 854 The current EDM condemning the murder of Danilo Anderson is still open. This means that MPs can still add their name to it (at the moment of writing, 7 have done so). The motion (EDM 127) reads: You can check whether your MP has signed or not ( http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=126 ), and then ask them to do so if they have not already. The motion correctly points to elements within the country and also elsewhere as responsible for the murder of Danilo Anderson. This is quite correct. In fact over the last few months there has been a consistent campaign in Miami , by opposition elements, openly calling for Chavez and other prominent figures of the revolutionary movement to be killed. The latest, but not the only, example of this was that of known TV presenter and prominent oppositionist Orlando Urdaneta. In an interview on Miami ’s Channel 22 TV station on October 25th, he said that “the way out of all of this is for this character [Chavez] to be eliminated”. The interviewer asked how Chavez could be “eliminated” and Urdaneta specified: “easy, just one person with a rifle with a scope”. In order not to leave any room for doubt he added: “if people are waiting for someone to give the order, I am giving it right now”. These people, Venezuelan and Cuban reactionary oppositionists, are free to openly call for terrorist activities while in Miami protected by US visas. This, like the case of the Miami Five (see The Cuban “Miami Five”: Jailed in the US for fighting terrorism ) shows the hypocrisy of the US administration and their so-called “war on terror”. The left wing Labour Member of Parliament John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion condemning the murder of Danilo Anderson, the Venezuelan prosecutor investigating the April 2002 military coup against president Chavez (see Prosecutor investigating anti-Chavez coup killed in terrorist attack ). John McDonnell has been a vocal supporter and collaborator of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign from the very beginning (see Successful Hands Off Venezuela meeting at Portcullis House (London, UK) ). The motion comes after another motion also moved by John McDonnell on November 17th ( EDM 854 ), which also condemned US interference in Venezuela and its efforts to remove the democratically elected president Hugo Chavez. On the House of Commons web site you can see the full text of the November 17 th motion and the list of thirty-two MPs who signed: EDM 854 The current EDM condemning the murder of Danilo Anderson is still open. This means that MPs can still add their name to it (at the moment of writing, 7 have done so). The motion (EDM 127) reads: You can check whether your MP has signed or not ( http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=126 ), and then ask them to do so if they have not already. The motion correctly points to elements within the country and also elsewhere as responsible for the murder of Danilo Anderson. This is quite correct. In fact over the last few months there has been a consistent campaign in Miami , by opposition elements, openly calling for Chavez and other prominent figures of the revolutionary movement to be killed. The latest, but not the only, example of this was that of known TV presenter and prominent oppositionist Orlando Urdaneta. In an interview on Miami ’s Channel 22 TV station on October 25th, he said that “the way out of all of this is for this character [Chavez] to be eliminated”. The interviewer asked how Chavez could be “eliminated” and Urdaneta specified: “easy, just one person with a rifle with a scope”. In order not to leave any room for doubt he added: “if people are waiting for someone to give the order, I am giving it right now”. These people, Venezuelan and Cuban reactionary oppositionists, are free to openly call for terrorist activities while in Miami protected by US visas. This, like the case of the Miami Five (see The Cuban “Miami Five”: Jailed in the US for fighting terrorism ) shows the hypocrisy of the US administration and their so-called “war on terror”.",NA,NA

			ESF meeting on the trade union situation in Venezuela and Colombia",2004-10-18T00:00:00Z,"
															
													HoV","On October 16 the ESF delegates had the chance to get a first hand report on the current situation in Colombia and Venezuela. The Colombia Solidarity Campaign and Hands Off Venezuela, supported by Marxist.com organised a workshop at the European Social Forum to explain the situation of the trade unions in these two Latin American countries. Around 65 campaigners, trade unionists and youth filled an already tiny room. The room was so full that some members of the audience had to sit on the floor! The meeting started with a contribution from Jeremy Dear. The NUJ General Secretary gave an account of the situation for trade unionists based on his own experience as a member of a TUC delegation to Colombia. The audience was terrified when they listened to all the security measures that trade union activists are forced to observe. He pointed out that the trade union and peasant leaders are currently slaughtered and tortured by the army and the paramilitaries because they are in the forefront of the struggle against privatisation. Jeremy Dear compared the Colombian conditions with the Venezuelan situation for trade unionists and he highlighted the freedom that trade unions enjoy in Venezuela. He closed his contribution appealing to the audience to campaign for the defence of the Venezuelan revolution and in defence of the Colombian trade union activity against US imperialism. After the NUJ General Secretary spoke, Jorge Martin (Hands Off Venezuela International Secretary) explained the origins of the Venezuelan UNT in relation to the defeat of the bosses lock-out at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003. He also said that in spite of the fact that the labour movement in Venezuela has not led the revolution, the workers played a very important role in the defeat of the lock-out and they even installed workers’ control in some PDVSA (state oil company) plants and occupied factories as a measure to protect production against the bosses’ sabotage. On the links between the Chavez government and the UNT he pointed out that there is a healthy and friendly relation between trade union and government. However, the UNT is completely autonomous from the government. In fact the UNT has openly expressed disagreement with some measures taken by the government. Dave Raby, recently arrived from Caracas after finishing a seminar at the Venezuelan Bolivarian University, also contributed to the discussion. Dave Raby analysed the origins of the Venezuelan Revolution. He explained how the conscious action of the Venezuelan masses has changed the whole country. Mr Raby stated: “What is happening in Venezuela is the beginning of a revolutionary breakthrough”. He gave a full account of the “Misiones” (social programmes on healthcare, housing, etc.) and how the actual implementation is due to the autonomous organisations in the communities. He also talked about how the economic treaties sponsored by the Venezuelan government seek to oppose the US backed treaties like the FTAA. Gonzalo Gomez from Aporrea.org (the main left-wing political website in Venezuela) began his contribution by talking about the “reciprocal solidarity” between Venezuela and the peoples of Europe and other advanced countries. He expressed the Venezuelan people’s rejection of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He linked the attacks launched by the US on Iraq with the active intervention of the US administration in Venezuela to plot against the revolution. In his contribution he also stressed the need to push for the alternative media. He stated, “We cannot rely on the bosses media”. He said that the media should be linked to the community and the labour movement. Gonzalo Gomez also hailed the process whereby the CTV (the tool of the oligarchy within the trade union movement) is being replaced by the UNT, the new and anti-capitalist trade union. One of the main concerns of the Aporrea.org editor was the bureaucratisation of the movement and the state apparatus in Venezuela. In order to stop this bureaucratisation the process which has been called “revolution within the revolution” was badly needed. He also said that the Venezuelan government was a popular government but not a government of the workers and the people yet because the bosses were still sacking workers. However, he denied that the Chavez government was a bosses’ government and he enthusiastically supported all the progressive measures implemented by the government and the favourable conditions for the class struggle in Venezuela. Andy Higginbottom introduced the Killer-Cola campaign. This campaign is the actual implementation of an international appeal launched by SINALTRAINAL (food and beverages processing workers’ union in Venezuela) to raise awareness of the awful situation of the Colombian activists and to expose the Coca-Cola corporation for its involvement in the assassination of a long list of their workers and shop stewards actively involved in the union. He also linked the struggle against imperialism in Colombia with the Bolivarian Revolution. A victory for the Venezuelan Revolution will be a step forward in the struggle against imperialism and its puppets in Colombia.

													our correspondent","Supporters of Hands off Venezuela and ""Der Funke"" have stepped up their activites in solidarity with the Venezuelan revolution in the last few days. In Nürnberg, we had a stall at a left wing book fair last weekend and collected signatures for the Venepal workers there. A discussion meeting was held on Saturday night to inform about the background of recent events in Venezuela and tell the audience about the need to support workers´ struggles as a driving force in the process. In his introduction, Hans-Gerd Öfinger outlined the development of the new militant union federation UNT and appealed to trade unionists present to build direct links with the UNT on all levels and fight for the recognition of the UNT as the sole legitimate representation of the Venezuelan labour movement. He also stressed the need to support the occupation of the Venepal factory and the call for nationalisation under workers´ control. A successful struggle of the Venepal workers could be a breakthrough for the whole labour movement and the overall revolutionary process. Anybody who wishes to carry out solidarity work with the revolution should recognise the importance of the organised labour movement in this context. Trade unionists present agreed to raise the question of the UNT in their local organisations, putting pressure upon the German union apparatus to fully support this new militant union. A few days later, the petition for the Venepal workers was signed at a meeting of the media and paper workers´ section in ver.di (Germany´s biggest union) in the Hessen region. The signatures include shop stewards from paper and packageing factories as well as full time union employees. Last Tuesday, comrades in Frankfurt organised a successful HOV solidarity meeting at the local university of applied sciences. 38 students came along to watch the legendary documentary film on the 2002 coup and a slide show by an HOV activist who had recently visited Venezuela.

			Successful Hands Off Venezuela meetings in France",2004-11-05T00:00:00Z,"
															
													La Riposte","Two successful Hands Off Venezuela meetings were organised this week in France by the Marxist journal La Riposte , which has been supporting the campaign since the very beginning. The first meeting took place on Tuesday, November 2nd in the headquarters of the French Communist Party 10th District in Paris. Some 56 people packed the meeting room, to the point where some had to sit in the staircase. Jorge Martin from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign explained the situation in Venezuela after the defeat of the reactionary opposition in the recent regional and council elections and the August 15th recall referendum. These two electoral defeats, he explained, clearly destroyed the myth propagated by the opposition and repeated by the international media, that Chavez was widely unpopular and that the majority of the people were against him. The balance of forces was now even more favourable to the revolution and this should be used to complete the revolution by putting the economy firmly in the hands of working people. Martin explained how Chavez had explicitly said that “within the framework of capitalism the problems of poverty, inequality and oppression cannot be solved”. A lively debate followed Jorge’s introduction. A veteran comrade from the Nanterre section of the PCF spoke. He had been to Venezuela recently and explained his experiences, including giving revolutionary solidarity greetings to a rally of poor peasants fighting for land reform and the extremely enthusiastic response he got from them. Other comrades spoke, including a leading CGT trade unionist from the Paris building workers union, and a number of comrades from Latin America who were also present. Also amongst the audience were a number of Arab intellectuals and journalists covering the meeting for some of the Arab media (including one of the most important Arab language newspapers, Al Quds). The meeting in Toulouse took place on Thursday, November 4th, at the University of Toulouse-Mirail. Nearly 120 people participated in this excellent meeting which was the third successful meeting organised by La Riposte at this university campus in the last year. Again, Jorge Martin, after explaining the current situation in Venezuela, described some of the debates that are taking place within the revolutionary movement and which are vital for the victorious completion of the Bolivarian revolution. These are mainly centred on the question of how to fight against bureaucrats and careerists within the movement itself and how to deal with the question of the economy. In the debate, one Venezuelan person argued that the movement led by Chavez was not a genuine revolution since the most important leaders of the left in the 60s and 70s were now with the opposition, and that it was a Manichaeist view to argue that in Venezuela the struggle was between Chavez and the poor on one side and the oligarchy on the other. Jorge replied that those historical leaders of the left who were now in the opposition (Petkoff, Marti, Melo and others) had in fact betrayed everything they had claimed to be fighting for in their revolutionary years. In fact Petkoff had already been a Minister in the Caldera government in the 1990s when he was in charge of privatisations. Jorge added that this was not a new phenomenon and that we had also seen the main guerrilla commander of El Salvador’s FMLN turn into an adviser to Uribe’s right wing pro-imperialist government in Colombia. He explained how despite the betrayal of many of the leaders of the Left, the overwhelming majority of the revolutionary rank and file activists from the past were now active in the Bolivarian revolution. As for the charge of Manichaeism, Jorge explained how the facts show that in the poor working class areas of Caracas, support for Chavez in elections stands at 70 to 80%, while in the rich and middle class areas of the East of Caracas support for the opposition was also 70 to 80%, thus clearly showing the class divisions between Bolivarians and oppositionists. Amongst the audience there were a number of Venezuelans and students from other Latin American countries. Also present were some CGT trade unionists from the aerospace industry around Toulouse who had come to listen to the meeting. One of the main points of the meetings was the appeal to organise some concrete and long lasting solidarity work with the Venezuelan revolution. At the end of the meeting a group of Venezuelan and French comrades agreed to set up the Toulouse Bolivarian Circle to continue with this work. It was agreed that one of the tasks of the Bolivarian Circle would be to raise the issue of recognition for the new Venezuelan trade union, UNT, within the CGT metal workers federation, which the aerospace trade unionists present belong to.
